    "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:vue/recommended"
    ],
    "rules": {
    "vue/html-self-closing": "off"
    }
}
 I also have this in my settings.json "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
      "source.fixAll.eslint": true
},
"vetur.validation.template": true,
 I tried to, purposely spell component wrong. import Task from "./Task.vue" export default { name: "Tasks", props: { tasks: Array }, component: { Task } } When I saved the file, It didn't stop me and highlight that I spelled wrong. What did I do wrong here ? Can someone please help me get my VSCode going with eslint for vue.js ? vue.js visual-studio-code eslint vscode-settings vetur Share Follow asked 4 hours ago code8888code8888 46.2k8989 gold badges273273 silver badges462462 bronze badges 1 Vue allows adding custom options to the component declaration, so component wouldn't be considered a typo. – tony19 2 hours ago Add a comment | 1 Answer 1 Active Oldest Votes 1 I didn't found a way to prevent this specific typo, but adding this to your rules inside .eslintrc file would give you a heads up next time. "vue/no-restricted-component-options": [
        "error",
        {
            "name": "component",
            "message": "Use \"components\" instead."
        }
    ]
