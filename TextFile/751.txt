He graduated from the Tudor Vladimirescu Military Lyceum in Craiova in 1985 and from the Nicolae B?lcescu Land Forces Academy in Sibiu in 1988.[1] During his military career, he participated in missions in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Iraq. From 2001 to 2004 he was commander of the 26th Infantry Battalion (also known as the Red Scorpions), with which he participated in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Ancient Babylon in Iraq. In May 2004, at Nasiriyah, Iraq, he led Romanian troops in an armed engagement, reportedly the first battle in which Romanians were "active combatants" since World War II.[1] He was promoted to the rank of General on 25 October 2010.[1][2] In 2015, he replaced ?tefan D?nil? [ro] as Chief of the Romanian General Staff.[3] His 4-year post under this office was extended for another year by the Romanian President Klaus Iohannis in 2018.[1][3] This caused a conflict between Iohannis, the Prime Minister Viorica D?ncil?, and the then Minister of Defense, Gabriel-Beniamin Le? [ro], who intended to change office.[3] Political career[edit] See also: Ciuc? Cabinet The National Liberal Party (PNL) proposed Ciuc? as Minister of Defense of the First Orban Cabinet.[2][1] He was transferred as a reserve on 28 October 2019,[3] being succeeded as Chief of the Romanian General Staff by Daniel Petrescu.[4] He became the Minister of Defence of Romania on 4 November 2019.[5] In October 2020, he joined the National Liberal Party (PNL) to run as a senator for the Senate of Romania in the next legislative elections[6] and was elected.[7] On 7 December 2020, following the resignation of Prime Minister Ludovic Orban, he was named the acting Prime Minister by Iohannis. He led as caretaker the government until a new coalition government was formed under Florin Cî?u in 23 December as a consequence of the result of the 2020 Romanian legislative election.[8][9] However, after the Cî?u Cabinet was dissolved through a motion of no confidence on 5 October 2021,[10] Iohannis nominated Ciuc? as Prime Minister-designate on 21 October 2021.[11] While the Magyar Democratic Union of Romania (UDMR) quickly agreed to renew a minority government with the PNL, the Social Democratic Party (PSD) offered to support him temporarily during the COVID-19 pandemic in exchange for agreeing to 10 measures.[12] He presented his government on 29 October.[13] Having failed to win the support of the PSD or the Union for the Salvation of Romania (USR), he gave up forming a government on 1 November.[14] Ciuc? submitted his term as prime minister on 1 November 2021.[15] Ciuc? was nominated again as Prime Minister-designate on 22 November 2021[16] and was confirmed by the parliament on 25 November after receiving 318 votes in favor.[17] He was sworn in the office hours later.[18] Awards[edit] Ciuc? is the recipient of the Ordre national du Mérite of the French Republic, Commander rank,[19] and of the National Order of Merit of Romania, Commander rank.[20] In 2019 he was awarded the Order of the Star of Romania, Officer rank.[21] In 2020 he was awarded the Legion of Merit by U.S. Ambassador Adrian Zuckerman.[22] Personal life[edit] As of 2019[update], Ciuc? is married and has a child.[1] See also[edit] Orban I Cabinet Orban II Cabinet Cî?u Cabinet Ciuc?
