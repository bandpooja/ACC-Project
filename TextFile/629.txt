It was founded by Shi Jingtang with aid from the Liao dynasty, which assumed suzerainty over the Later Jin. After Later Jin's second ruler, Shi Chonggui, fell out with the Liao, the Liao invaded in 946 and in 947, annihilated the Later Jin and annexed its former territories.

It extended Shatuo domains from their base in Shanxi to most of North China, and into Sichuan. After Li Cunxu’s death, his adopted son, Li Siyuan became emperor. However, the Shatuo relationship with the Khitans, which was vital to their rise to power, had soured. Shi Jingtang, the son-in-law of Li Cunxu, rebelled against him, and with the help of the Khitan, declared himself emperor of the Later Jin in 936. The Later Jin founder Shi Jingtang claimed patrilineal Han Chinese ancestry.[2] Noting that Shi ? is a typical Chinese surname borne by Sogdians, Barenghi (2014) traces Shi Jingtang's origin to the Anqing Shi (???). Anqing was one of the three Shatuo tribes, besides Chuyue (??) and formerly Türgesh-associated Suoge (??).[3][4][5] In the Later Jin, there were Dukedoms for the offspring of the royal families of the Zhou dynasty, Sui dynasty, and Tang dynasty.[6] This practice was referred to as the two crownings and the three respects (????). The Tang Imperial Longxi Li lineage (????) also included sub-lineages like the Guzang Li (???). Li Zhuanmei (???) descended from the Guzang Li and served the Later Jin.[7] Territory[edit] The Later Jin held essentially the same territories as the Later Tang, except for Sichuan, which had been lost by the Later Tang in its waning years and had become independent as Later Shu. The other major exception was a region known as the Sixteen Prefectures. By this time in history, the Khitan had formed the Liao dynasty out of their steppe base. They had also become a major power broker in North China. They forced the Later Jin to cede the strategic Sixteen Prefectures to the Liao. Consisting of a region about 70 to 100 miles wide and including modern-day Beijing and points westward, it was considered a highly strategic region, and gave the Liao even more influence in North China. Relations with the Liao dynasty[edit] The Later Jin had often been described as a puppet of the emerging Liao dynasty. The help of their powerful northern neighbors was vital in the formation of the Later Jin. The cession of the Sixteen Prefectures led to their derision as being the servants of the Liao dynasty. After the death of the founder of the dynasty, Shi Jingtang, his nephew, adopted son and successor Shi Chonggui defied the Liao, resulting in the latter invading in 946 and 947, resulting in the destruction of the Later Jin. After the Liao conquest of the Later Jin, the Liao took the dynastic element Water, which follows from the Later Jin's dynastic element Metal, according to the theory of Five Elements (wuxing).[8] List of emperors[edit] Sovereigns of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, 907–960 Temple name Posthumous name Personal name Period of reign Chinese era name and dates the Five Dynasties Convention: name of dynasty + temple name or posthumous name Hou (Later) Jin Dynasty 936–947 ??

Shi Jingtang actually claimed to be a descendant of Chinese historical figures Shi Que and Shi Fen, and insisted that his ancestors went westwards towards non-Han Chinese area during the political chaos at the end of the Han Dynasty in early 3rd century. ^ Golden, Peter Benjamin (1992).
