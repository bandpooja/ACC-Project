I'm Cassidy and I'm new to Patreon, and I'm so grateful that you're here. You might know me from my Scrabble mechanical keyboard, or my newsletter, or my React class, or my CSS art on CodePen, or one of my tech talks (I've given over a hundred over the past few years!), or maybe just from my Twitter feed full of lame jokes and videos. On this page, I'll be giving you an inside peek at what I'm doing and how I'm doing it. I tend to be most active on the Patreon Discord group, where we have a lively community of folks playing Minecraft, showing off side projects, and learning from each other! In supporting me through Patreon, you'll be directly supporting my content creation, organizations to which I donate time and money, and also some little goodies I'll send you over time. As it grows, I might make some streams of doing CSS art so you can see how I do it, I might take more suggestions on content for my newsletter, and I might even come up with something brand new (for example, some of the folks in this community and I are already organizing online meetups and events together)! This will be fun, and I'm so excited to get to meet you!
