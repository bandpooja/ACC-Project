Local cooperatives sold a large number of firecrackers for the event. At 9 p.m., the North Korean movie Ch?nu ("Comrade") was scheduled to be shown outdoors, but due to temperatures around ?20 to ?30 °C (?4 to ?22 °F), it was moved to the festival hall instead.[3] The festival hall was built in 1966, the first year of the Cultural Revolution. It had an area of 760 square metres (8,200 sq ft), with a usable floor space of 601 square metres (6,470 sq ft) and a wooden roof, with reeds,[5] two layers of oiled felt and three layers of asphalt. In 1972, a vertical gallery was added outside the main door of the hall with two cylindrical pillars a metre wide. The hall originally had 17 large windows and seven doors. For an informational session on farming, the hall was modified in March 1975, partially bricking the windows, leaving only windowless holes.[4] In February 1976, the hall underwent further modification, during which three of the doors were sealed and the other three were either locked or bound with steel wire, leaving only a 1.6-metre-wide (5.2 ft) main door on the south side of the building. When the fire occurred, the rear half of the hall was still occupied by various wreaths placed in September 1976 while mourning the death of Mao Zedong,[3] and the main door had apparently been half sealed, ostensibly to maintain order, leaving only an 80-centimetre (31 in) opening.[5] At around 9:30 p.m., the movie started. At 10:15 p.m., a primary school student, Zhao Guanghui, lit a "ground rat", a special type of firecracker that could jump after being set off.[6] On this occasion, it sprang into the pile of wreaths, setting the wreaths on fire.[7] The fire climbed to the ceiling, with the projection screen and wires mounted on the roof rapidly igniting, spreading dense smoke in the hall. The burning wooden panels fell and asphalt started falling off the roof. Due to the only exit being too small, most people were unable to escape, leading to high levels of casualties. According to witnesses it took only half an hour from the start of the fire to the roof collapse.[3] Casualties[edit] The fire killed 694[4][3][2][1] (697 in some accounts[5]) people and seriously injured 161 others. The majority of the dead (around 500 people) were students from the combined primary, middle and high schools.[3] Many had been found at the front door, in a stack of people around 2–3 metres (6.6–9.8 ft) high, while those unable to reach it were killed by burning asphalt or falling roof tiles.[5] The stack was made worse by those who brought their own chairs to watch the movie, which further blocked egress. Eventually, a hole was smashed in a sealed door on the northern side, allowing a few children to be rescued.[8] Aftermath[edit] After the fire broke out, on 19 February 1977, the Yili Military District phoned Huocheng and Huiyuan Counties, and the Yili Military District 8th Border Guards Regiment, requesting assistance at the 61st Division. Two companies from the 8th Regiment arrived, with around 280 soldiers. Each soldier was armed with a pickaxe, a crowbar and two masks.[3] The slow response was due to the closest firefighters being 80 km (50 mi) away.[1] ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? When the soldiers arrived, the spectators cleared out a path, but we still couldn't get in. Near the door, the corpses stacked up to a metre high. The majority of them were burnt like cinder, and some of them stuck together like asphalt. The air was filled with a retch-inducing smell, that you couldn't get near without wearing a mask. We held the crowbar and pickaxe, standing near the door and not knowing how to process this, and we didn't want to touch it. However, our job was to clear out the scene, so everybody had to do something. —?Chen Fuyuan, (???) deputy regiment leader at the scene[3] After a cleanup lasting around four hours, the job was mostly done. The deceased were placed in the yard surrounding the ruins of the hall.[3] The deputy party secretary of the Yili Farming Bureau, Ma Ji was the leading investigator for the "2.18" fire. He arrived at the on the morning of 19 February. Some relatives on site were angry, and tried placing the blame on Zhou Zhenfu, the local party secretary of Yili, unaware that he had lost his daughter in the fire. To calm the anger, at the end of February, Ma Ji also took the role of the party secretary of the 61st Division and took charge for the aftermath of the "2.18" fire.[3] After all the deceased were buried, some families of the deceased remained angry, and plotted to exhume the corpse of the daughter of Zhou Zhenfu in protest. Ma Ji convinced the upper level leaders to not prosecute any of the protestors, and he resolved the disturbance through his grants for families of victims to take holidays or switch to other jobs.[3] Due to the sensitive nature of the news[clarification needed] at the time, it was not heavily broadcast within China, although apparently it was already known by foreign media. The fire was initially blamed on Soviet revisionism, i.e. that it was set by class enemies. Afterwards, the fire was largely blamed on Zhao Guanghui, the child who set the firecracker, without seriously considering the effect of the abandoned wreaths.[5] Guanghui escaped unhurt before the main panic. Eventually, with his parents, he surrendered himself to the police. The month after the fire, he was sentenced to reform through labour and later to juvenile detention. After being released, he went to Guangdong. The people who organised the movie showing were detained for almost two and a half years, until the local court chose not to prosecute. The party officials responsible for the festival hall were demoted and sent to farms.[8] In July 1978, after the investigation was complete, Ma Ji was promoted to the deputy party secretary of Yining.[3] Memorials[edit] A memorial park, named Jianyuan started construction in 1997 after bulldozing the remains of the hall. It was designed to be a theme park on fire safety, but was yet to be finished in 2007.[3] The victims of the fire are buried at Sandapian, so named as this cemetery was formed by joining three pieces of land.[3][5] See also[edit] List of building or structure fires 1994 Karamay fire, 325 deaths 2003 Hengyang fire, building partially collapsed in the fire References[edit] ^ a b c "1977?????????12??"???"??500????????". xw.qq.com (in Chinese).
