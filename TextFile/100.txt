We keep a Slack channel called ask-help and it's used constantly.

Had enough of strict work practices, outmoded coding standards, and draconian time management? Frustrated by your daily commute, or not seeing your awesome ideas adopted? We hate these things, too.</p><br /><p>Axsy is passionate about creating outstanding software which delights its users. We&rsquo;re revolutionising the Salesforce apps which are used by businesses around the world. We&rsquo;ve operated as a remote-working team since we founded the company over 10 years ago, and will continue to do so even when pandemic restrictions are eased. We are looking for talented self-starters to join us. You can work from home or a shared workspace of your choosing.</p><br /><p>Our team is mainly based in the UK and we're only looking for applicants who live in the UK. If you need to fit work hours around other commitments, that&rsquo;s ok, and we trust that you can manage your own time effectively. We communicate using Slack, frequent video calls, and occasional in-person meet-ups (3-4 times per year). We're proud of both the team we&rsquo;ve created and what we&rsquo;ve achieved so far. We&rsquo;re punching above our weight and are expanding our team to achieve even more.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re still a relatively small team.

No regulations or hierarchy, just a lot of interesting and challenging work to get done. You&rsquo;ll work on our React Native mobile apps and React web apps, so we&rsquo;re looking for people who have extensive experience of Typescript and React. If you know React but not React Native, we think you&rsquo;ll pick it up pretty quickly. Knowledge of Redux, GraphQL, native modules, Java, C++, Salesforce is a bonus.</p><br /><p>The most important skill to us is being able to pick up new concepts and technologies rapidly. Ideally, you're the sort of person who has been programming from an early age, thrives on new challenges, is passionate about technology, takes pride in finding elegant solutions to difficult problems, and has a record of open source project involvement.

This includes server-side, client-side and mobile engineers working closely with UX experts, copywriters and designers. We follow a Kanban-like approach, using Google docs and Trello to specify and manage work; Github, CircleCI and Terraform Enterprise as part of an immutable-infrastructure, continuous delivery pipeline; and Loggly, Sentry and Cloudwatch to measure performance and monitor production. Engineering standards are high. We pair program, thoroughly review and test code before it deploys, and maintain fast, high-value test suites. We have weekly tech talks, monthly blitz-days (eg sharpening our internal tools, upgrading dependencies) and can often be found at tech meet-ups and conferences. Our <a href="https://github.com/octoenergy/styleguide" rel="nofollow">coding conventions are open-source</a> and we maintain a <a href="https://tech.octopus.energy/" rel="nofollow">tech blog</a>. Octopus is a great place to learn, work with some talented engineers and level-up your skills. <strong>Our technology</strong> On the server-side, we mainly use Python. Most of our websites are powered by Django and the Django-REST-framework. We also use Pandas, Numpy and Jupyter for analysis and forecasting, plus Celery, RabbitMQ, SQS and Airflow for background processing. We use AWS heavily, employing most of the "Hashistack" (eg Packer, Consul, Terraform) as part of a continuous deployment pipeline. See, for example, <a href="http://tech.octopus.energy/news/2016/05/05/django-elb-health-checks.html" rel="nofollow">Django, ELB health checks and continuous delivery</a>. Client-side, we use React, Redux and SASS; our mobile apps are built using React Native. <strong>What you'll do</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>We have lots of difficult <em>design challenges</em> to solve. The UK energy market is complicated, outdated and process-heavy - there's an awful lot of domain modelling that we need to get right. Strong attention to detail is essential.</li><br /><li>We have difficult <em>technical problems</em> to solve. With the advent of smart meters, we'll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption.</li><br /><li>There's a great opportunity for disruption in the UK energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not exactly popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more dis-aggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology. Octopus Energy were the first UK supplier to introduce a "tracker" tariff whose prices track the daily wholesale prices: <a href="http://www.cleanenergynews.co.uk/news/efficiency/octopus-offers-transparency-with-wholesale-price-tariff" rel="nofollow">http://www.cleanenergynews.co.uk/news/efficiency/octopus-offers-transparency-with-wholesale-price-tariff</a></li><br /><li>You'll be working for a company that&rsquo;s fighting climate change. Our parent company is the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and are funding wind and anaerobic digestion. As a supplier, we're helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>What you'll have </strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>We're looking for someone with a general interest in technology and problem-solving; someone diligent and thoughtful. It would be helpful to have experience/expertise in the following (in rough priority order):</li><br /><li>Python</li><br /><li>Django (or equiv. web framework)</li><br /><li>Domain modelling</li><br /><li>HTTP and REST APIs</li><br /><li>Writing robust and fault-tolerant software</li><br /><li>Celery and async processing</li><br /><li>Postgres</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Plus experience in the following would be a bonus:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>AWS</li><br /><li>Terraform, Packer, Consul</li><br /><li>React and Redux</li><br /></ul>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 14:19:50 Z2021-11-30T14:19:50ZLondon, UK548345 https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/548345/ios-developer-for-george-all-genders-erste-group?a=2XTFycwmyJ44&so_medium=Talent&so_source=TalentApiErste Groupiosswiftuikitswiftuigit iOS Developer for George (all genders) at Erste Group (Wien, Österreich)<p><strong>Banking has a name.

You'll have the opportunity to work in Product Development teams in different domains, both greenfield products as well as evolving existing ones.</p><br /><p>Why are we looking for polyglot developers? Well, we know everyone has their favourite language or framework, but we also know that it&rsquo;s important to use the right tool/language/framework for the job at hand, and that a pragmatic approach might mean using a language that is already in production. Also, polyglot developers tend to focus on core software engineering principles and practices, rather than what is shiny in a new framework or language. So whilst we usually work with JavaScript it doesn&rsquo;t mean we aren&rsquo;t able to transfer our engineering skills and work with other languages when it makes sense.</p><br /><p>Through regular Learning Lunches, Technical Brown Bags, Software Crafters Meetups, Start of Week meetings, Team Offsites and other social and community events, our team learns and collaborates together and is always sharing knowledge and helping each other, both within Pragmateam, clients and the community.</p><br /><p>To be successful in this role you must have an open mind to sometimes work with a language that is not your usual one and most likely consider yourself a polyglot, ie. someone who is happy to learn new languages or further develop their skills if needed for the task at hand. You must also love developing the skills of other software engineers and helping them improve their craft and capability.

While microservices have a host of benefits (improved scalability, ease of deployment, and organization), they do lead to a drastic increase in the architectural complexity. As organizations adopt dozens or even hundreds of services, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand the whole ecosystem and ensure reliability. That&rsquo;s the problem we want to solve.</p><br /><p>RunX is building a microservices platform. We want to make engineers more productive by supercharging creation and operation of microservices. Think of an observability layer above AWS and kubernetes that will become the command center for modern engineering teams.</p><br /><p><strong>About Us </strong></p><br /><p>We are a small team of experienced industry veterans who have several years of experience in leading Infra/Devtools teams for various silicon valley companies.</p><br /><p>Our CEO started the Infra team at Flexport (multi billion SF unicorn) and led the company through a major microservices transition. We&rsquo;ve seen first hand the pain experienced in such environments and are really passionate about solving it. We are venture funded and backed by industry legends such as Jyoti Bansal (AppDynamics founder) and John Vrionis (Lead investor in AppDynamics, Nicira, and Nimble Storage). We also have an illustrious group of Silicon Valley CTOs, CEOs and CISOs among our angel investors.

A company is only as amazing as the set of people who comprise it - so you&rsquo;ll help set the foundation for the next 10yrs of RunX. About you RunX is looking for an experienced builder who excels in wide open environments. We value autonomy and initiative very highly.

While this transformation brings its own specific set of challenges, we believe that solving them one after another will allow us to fully achieve our mission. Are you interested in working together to take on these exciting challenges?</p><br /><p><strong><strong>Our Culture</strong> </strong></p><br /><p>Mercari&rsquo;s culture has been central to the company since our founding, with the three core values of Go Bold, All for One, and Be a Pro. In addition, the &ldquo;Trust &amp; Openness&rdquo; value was introduced to embody our culture of mutual trust, where information remains transparent and rules are kept to a minimum. Regardless of how big Mercari gets, our culture is essential to achieving our mission and will be promoted throughout our organization.</p><br /><p><strong><strong>Position Overview</strong></strong></p><br /><p><strong><strong>Work Responsibilities</strong></strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li><br /><p>At Mercari, we have been making changes in order to implement a microservice architecture on the backend of our app. However, some of our core systems (for example, the Item Transaction feature) are still running as part of the PHP monolithic application that has supported our growth so far. Our team is responsible for developing and maintaining these core systems. Given that the systems are complex and have a long history at Mercari, agile development remains a challenge for us. To solve this, we have to ensure that our core systems are loosely coupled in order for us to both augment these systems and contribute to our business growth going forward.</p><br /></li><br /></ul><br /><ul><br /><li><br /><p>The Mercari Engineering Division has defined this new direction as building a "Robust Foundation for Speed." In order to achieve our company mission under this new direction, rather than migrating to microservices, we have taken on a more essential and worthwhile challenge: modularizing. Specific work responsibilities for this position include the following:</p><br /><ul><br /><li><br /><p>Developing and maintaining core features (PHP or Go, etc. as needed)</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Designing loosely coupled/modular systems</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Working with PMs on a series of development tasks (plan, design, implementation, QA, release, etc.)</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Investigating inquiries from customer support or other development teams</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Conducting system operation tasks, including responding to alerts while on call</p><br /></li><br /></ul><br /></li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong><strong>Bold Challenges</strong></strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li><br /><p>Besides your software engineering skills, in this position, you will be able to utilize comprehensive problem-solving skills. You will need to approach these problems by setting and testing hypotheses, and you will need a lot of curiosity and attention to detail in order to tackle core systems that run a huge number of item transactions everyday. These are important systems that handle user assets, so it&rsquo;s important to go beyond our team&rsquo;s domain to understand the features&rsquo; end-to-end behavior and how they relate to other features. Some features, however, can be hard to fully understand simply by reading the code because they are too complex or old. This will require that you embrace some level of uncertainty and strategically set and test hypotheses to check them. Additionally, you will need to always keep your goals in mind and try to find solutions thinking outside the box.</p><br /></li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong><strong>Required Experience</strong></strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li><br /><p>Shared belief in Mercari&rsquo;s mission and values</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Experience developing and operating systems for large-scale products, selecting technologies and improving their codebase</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Experience in API development using programming languages such as Go, PHP, or Java</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Experience in designing and developing with databases (MySQL or similar RDBMS)</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Ability to design and develop products while considering performance and scalability</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Extensive knowledge of object-oriented software development, networks, memory management, and software testing</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Good communication skills to collaborate with stakeholders and teammates on product development</p><br /></li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong><strong>Preferred Experience</strong></strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li><br /><p>Domain knowledge in e-commerce, order management, payments, shipping and delivery, etc.</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Experience with project management or team leadership</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Experience with Scrum</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Experience developing and operating systems using microservice architecture</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Knowledge of and experience with databases (RDBMS/NoSQL), networks, Linux, monitoring systems, logging, and SLO/SLA</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Experience with software development in the cloud (GCP, AWS or Azure)</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Experience contributing to an open-source project</p><br /></li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong><strong>Language Requirements</strong></strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li><br /><p>Fulfills either of the following:</p><br /><ul><br /><li><br /><p>a.

We achieve this by linking learning to kids&rsquo; interests, connecting them with other classmates who share their passions, and giving them the autonomy to pick their own paths. Our small group classes meet over live video chat with teachers who celebrate their unique strengths and empower all learners to develop confidence and a strong sense of self.</p><br /><p>We're also focused on removing barriers for historically underserved learners who face systemic challenges to their success. In 2020, we started Outschool.org and began offering financial assistance to families in need. We are currently creating an Educator Endowment Fund to appreciate the teachers who are so central to our mission of inspiring kids to love learning.</p><br /><p>We believe that diversity drives learning. To meet our mission, we encourage, support, and celebrate different ideas, perspectives, and backgrounds. As a fully distributed (remote) team, we challenge one another to find the most effective way to empower learners, teachers, and parents. Your name, race, religion, gender, nationality, sexual orientation, and age are not barriers; they are why we want to work with you. We invite talented and creative candidates who value the importance of nurturing a child's boundless curiosity to join us on this journey.</p><br /><p>The pandemic has been challenging for families all over the globe. We acted quickly and worked together to provide quality resources to learners, parents, and teachers in the past year. As communities worldwide rethink their approach to education, Outschool will continue to innovate and provide kids with unique opportunities to explore their passions.</p><br /><p><em>Earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/outschool-series-c-unicorn/?utm_campaign=All%20%7C%20Funding%20Announce&amp;utm_content=162315913&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;hss_channel=lcp-6600171" rel="nofollow">Techcrunch</a> recognized Outschool as the newest EdTech unicorn.

We also use Python and other frameworks/languages where appropriate.<br /><br />We believe that the future of education is hybrid - online and in person. We are looking for engineers with extensive industry experience who are excited about inspiring children to learn by building tools that allow children to access a fundamentally different learning experience. We value hands-on experience most of all. Here are some examples of projects we have recently tackled:<br /><br />- We migrated our backend from Heroku to AWS, and we are in the process of migrating the application layer.<br />- We built a recommendation engine for classes that best fit learners&rsquo; interests, it soon turned out to be one of the most used features of our site.<br />- We are in the process of fully revamping <a href="https://outschool.com/online-classes#usrDNS82un" rel="nofollow">our search</a> using ElasticSearch, Kafka, and home grown data pipelines.<br />- We built a new app area, dedicated just to learners.

We want to foster an environment where team members have frequent opportunities to learn from each other in fields that they are not (yet) experts.</p><br /><p>The machine learning and data science we employ comes in several varieties: image processing, signal processing, classical supervised modeling, unsupervised methods, exploratory data analysis, and fundamental statistics and probability.</p><br /><p>We are grateful to stand on the shoulders of the open source giants. We use NumPy-flavored Python3 as the basis for our development, taking advantage of the availability of libraries designed for both software engineering and data science, ranging from Flask to SciPy, SQLAlchemy to Keras, Jupyter to Pandas, and many more. When Python&rsquo;s time or space complexity becomes a constraint, we turn to modern C++. When we require client-side browser-based interactivity, we turn to JavaScript. As a python backend developer, your specific expertise as well as your motivation would be the major factors in determining your day-to-day work.</p><br /><p><strong>ABOUT THE JOB</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Develop, implement and maintain innovative software for industrial systems</li><br /><li>Leverage your own experience and expertise by bringing up your inventive ideas</li><br /><li>Work alongside machine learning engineers to optimize visualizations and product experience</li><br /><li>Create data pipelines that are directly integrated into industrial production processes</li><br /><li>Develop data-oriented backends for customer-facing web applications</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>QUALIFICATIONS THAT CATCH OUR EYE</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Bachelor&rsquo;s, Master&rsquo;s or Ph.D. in Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Physics or Engineering</li><br /><li>Experience working with a variety of databases</li><br /><li>Experience in data engineering</li><br /><li>Experience working alongside and within a Python server framework, especially Flask</li><br /><li>Experience in Linux is a must</li><br /><li>Knowledge of machine learning technologies is a plus</li><br /><li>Fluency in German or Russian is a plus; English is required</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Transparency of business strategies</li><br /><li>Autonomy balanced by responsibility</li><br /><li>Cohesive, multidisciplinary team</li><br /><li>Meaningful industrial problems</li><br /><li>Modern machine learning techniques</li><br /><li>Modern software stack</li><br /><li>Sleek, new office located in Berlin</li><br /><li>Professional educational opportunities</li><br /><li>German language courses and public transport included</li><br /><li>Free drinks and fruits</li><br /></ul>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 12:00:34 Z2021-11-20T12:00:34ZBerlin, Germany552575 https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/552575/senior-developer-nodejs-react-aws-tdd-uk-home-office?a=2ZjCGStjoJZS&so_medium=Talent&so_source=TalentApiUK Home Officejavaamazon-web-servicesc#javascriptkubernetes Senior Developer - Node.js | React | AWS | TDD | CI/CD at UK Home Office (Croydon, UK)<p>We sit at the heart of the Home Office&rsquo;s transformation into being a data driven department.<br><br>You&rsquo;ll be working on some of the most high-reaching, high profile problems in Government, across all areas of the Home Office&rsquo;s responsibilities:<br><br></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Border Security, Immigration Control &amp; Citizenship</li><br /><li>Crime and Policing &amp; Fire Services</li><br /><li>National Security, Counter Terrorism and Counter Extremism</li><br /></ul><br /><p><br>It&rsquo;s an exciting area where you&rsquo;ll be working with outstanding datasets, sophisticated analytical techniques and modern tools to deliver insights and data products that will transform our operational business and policy development.</p><br /><p><strong>About the team</strong></p><br /><p>We work in small agile teams, to deliver prioritised work packages from the research stage through to deployment as live services.
