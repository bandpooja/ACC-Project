Wikipedia:In the news/Candidates - Wikipedia Wikipedia:In the news/Candidates From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia < Wikipedia:In the news Jump to navigation Jump to search Page for suggesting items for "In the news" Welcome to In the news. Please read the guidelines. Admin instructions are here. ??Skip to suggestions In the news toolbox Error reports Nominations (Archives) Discussion General criteria Death criteria Recurring items Admin guide Image protection Current events portal v t e Shortcut WP:ITN/C This page provides a forum for editors to suggest items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page, as well as the forum for discussion of candidates. This is not the page to report errors in the ITN section on the Main Page—please go to the appropriate section at WP:ERRORS. Archives of past nominations can be found here. This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. Under each daily section header below is the transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day (with a light green header). Each day's portal page is followed by a subsection for suggestions and discussion. A blurb is a one sentence summary of the news story. An alternate suggestion for the blurb is called an altblurb, and any more suggestions get labelled alt1, alt2, etc. A blurb needs at least one target article, highlighted in bold; reviewers check the quality of that article and whether it is updated, and whether reliable sources demonstrate the significance of the event. Other articles can also be linked. The Ongoing line is for regularly updated articles which cover events that remain in the news over a longer period of time. RD stands for the "recent deaths" line, and can include any living thing whose death was recently announced. In some cases, recent deaths may need additional explanation as provided by a blurb; this is decided by consensus.

Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates. These are automatically generated (at midnight UTC) by a bot; creating them manually breaks this process. Nominate the blurb for ITN inclusion under the "Suggestions" subheading for the date, emboldening the link in the blurb to the updated article. Use a level 4 header (====) when doing so. Preferably use the template {{ITN candidate}} to nominate the article related to the event in the news. Make sure that you include a reference from a verifiable, reliable secondary source. Press releases are not acceptable. The suggested blurb should be written in simple present tense. Adding an explanation why the event should be posted greatly increases the odds of posting. Please consider alerting editors to the nomination by adding the template {{ITN note}} to the corresponding article's talk page. Purge this page to update the cache There are criteria which guide the decision on whether or not to put a particular item on In the news, based largely on the extensiveness of the updated content and the perceived significance of the recent developments. These are listed at WP:ITN. Submissions that do not follow the guidelines at Wikipedia:In the news will not be placed onto the live template. Headers[edit] Items that have been posted or pulled from the main page are generally marked with (Posted) or (Pulled) in the item's subject so it is clear they are no longer active. Items can also be marked as (Ready) when the article is both updated and there seems to be a consensus to post. The posting admin, however, should always judge the update and the consensus to post themselves. If you find an entry that you don't feel is ready to post is marked (Ready), you should remove the mark in the header. Voicing an opinion on an item[edit] Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated. Please do not...[edit] add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are usually not helpful. Instead, explain the reasons why you think the item meets or does not meet the ITN inclusion criteria so a consensus can be reached. oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism). Conflicts of interest are not handled at ITN. comment on a story without first reading the relevant article(s). oppose a recurring item here because you disagree with the recurring items criteria. The criteria can be discussed at the relevant talk page.

I think it would be more generalized and more of a country issue than a "someone gets elected" issue. But I won't strongly oppose it either. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 14:58, 29 November 2021 (UTC) For the record: the posted wording in October was Ahead of Barbados becoming a republic, Sandra Mason is elected as the country's first president. Brandmeistertalk 15:53, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Comment – As I understand it, Barbados already was independent (since 1966), and this move merely means the British monarch will no longer be titular head of state. Thus, just a formality. (Unless I'm missing something – a distinct possibility – I'm not sure how this affects political life in Barbados.) – Sca (talk) 15:15, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Australia had a constitutional crisis in 1975 when the royal governor of the Queen of Australia fired the prime minister due to an approaching government shutdown.

Joseph2302 (talk) 15:33, 29 November 2021 (UTC) This is a change in the form of government which takes effect now, as Barbados is no longer a Commonwealth realm. Brandmeistertalk 15:53, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Which also has the consequence of the head of government changing, which is why I think this nomination should be considered ITNR. Joseph2302 (talk) 17:12, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Comment we already posted the election of the new president so the blurb should just be about becoming a republic. --Tone 16:02, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Support This is an important development. Maybe you should rewrite the blurb to make Republicanism in Barbados, the main article. Another reason is the minimum quality requirement. Barbados is an enormous article and is "as good as it gets." KittenKlub (talk) 16:08, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Support. We posted the election, but a country changing its form of government is uncommon(especially without a violent revolution). I agree with Alsoriano97 that we don't need to mention the first female status again. 331dot (talk) 17:05, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Support although Republicanism in Barbados seems like a better target than Barbados, as it has much more detail on the event in question. Technically, she takes office on 30 November, so should probably wait until tomorrow to post (as she hasn't actually become the head of state until then). Joseph2302 (talk) 17:12, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Support a rewritten blurb with Republicanism in Barbados as the bolded article, but wait until 30 November per all. – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 17:15, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Support Tommorow Historic and notable event, and technically ITNR, though I'm not sure how much it applies. Regardless, it qualifies on it's own merits, something like this doesn't happen every day let alone very few decades. Support altblurb with Republicanism in Barbados as target.

Alternative blurb II: In Sweden, Magdalena Andersson, who resigned suddenly on November 24 after one day as PM-designate, is elected Prime Minister by the Swedish parliament. Alternative blurb III: Social Democrat Magdalena Andersson, who resigned suddenly on November 24 after one day as PM-designate, is elected Prime Minister by the Swedish parliament.

News source(s): AP, BBC, Reuters, DW Credits: Updated and nominated by BabbaQ (talk · give credit) Updated by Vacant0 (talk · give credit) The nominated event is listed on WP:ITN/R, so each occurrence is presumed to be important enough to post. Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article and update meet WP:ITNCRIT, not the significance. Nominator's comments: feel free to add other better blurbs. BabbaQ (talk) 13:24, 29 November 2021 (UTC) It's been a wild week in Sweden. The article is sufficient, but the process by which she became Prime Minister is rather messy; I'm not sure if we should (or even if we can) cover it in a blurb, but if someone can come up with something less bland, it bears explanation. She was actually elected on November 24, was scheduled to take office on November 26, but in the intervening 48 hours her coalition suffered a loss of supply vote, causing the Green Party to withdraw from the coalition, causing a collapse of the government. She and her party then spent three days organizing a single-party government, after which she was elected a second time to the PM post. She still has never been formally appointed to the post, FWIW. That is still forthcoming. Not sure how to blurbify that, but the process is a major part of the news story here. --Jayron32 13:41, 29 November 2021 (UTC) She will as far as I understand it become PM tomorrow. And this is now a final vote, which can not become null and void. She now is PM elect.BabbaQ (talk) 13:58, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: So perhaps we should slot this news for tomorrow instead when she has been formally instated (don't wanna jinx things here!) and a blurb can be: "After a politically turbulent week, twice-elected Magdalena Andersson becomes Sweden's first female Prime Minister". cart-Talk 14:08, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Wait until she actually becomes PM, as before that, the blurb is incorrect. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:02, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Added altblurb per this RTE article. The altblurb is more precise, more unusual and thus likely to be more interesting to our readers, and is worded so that it does not require waiting until whenever she actually assumes office. Tlhslobus (talk) 14:27, 29 November 2021 (UTC) I've changed Prime Minister to Prime minister-designate; Prime Minister can be restored once she actually takes office. Tlhslobus (talk) 14:41, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Support altblurb (as explained above). Tlhslobus (talk) 14:32, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Support ALT1 which can be changed to ALT0 when she actually takes office. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:56, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Wait until tomorrow when we can say she is the first female PM. It will be a much less confusing blurb. No need to spill over the messiness from our Riksdag onto ITN. Besides, she has already been on ITN as 'elected', better to have a 'become' blurb this time. Keep it simple. cart-Talk 15:10, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Add Just listened to the news on Swedish Radio (our equivalent of BBC), even those reporters signed off with the caveat about Andersson's election: "Unless something unforeseen happens...". Nobody's taking anything for granted right now. cart-Talk 15:50, 29 November 2021 (UTC) This is exactly why ITN cannot and should not be a news ticker.--WaltCip-(talk) 15:19, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Topically significant, but per cart wait 'til it's offcial. – Sca (talk) 15:26, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Support altblurb. Article is short, but sufficient. Altblurb captures the unusual nature of the election in a neutral and encyclopedic way. Agnostic on timing (now or after it becomes official), if we do post it early I like Tlhsobus's plan of changing the link when she becomes official. --Jayron32 16:58, 29 November 2021 (UTC) But let's not link Sweden per MOS:OVERLINK. cart-Talk 17:10, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Obviously. But the wording works, otherwise. --Jayron32 19:00, 29 November 2021 (UTC) I've now removed the wikilink from Sweden.Tlhslobus (talk) 20:44, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Let's wait. I'd rather have Barbados atop ITN tomorrow, then a simple blurb about the new PM taking office on ITN the day after when the dust settles in Sweden.--PFHLai (talk) 18:41, 29 November 2021 (UTC) When it does become official, a corrective blurb alluding to her sudden resignation last week would be helpful for reader comprehension. – Sca (talk) 19:19, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Support Ok, this time it worked, and she's been PM for about an hour now. cart-Talk 13:04, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Support – Done d-d-d-deal. Favor alt3. Suggest this pic. – Sca (talk) 13:53, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose ALT2 as she never actually became PM the first time. It was scheduled for 26 November, but she resigned on 24 November. ALT0 is correct, so should be used instead. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:01, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Good point. So I've revised Alt2 accordingly (above), and favor it once again. Thanks. – Sca (talk) ALT2 now looks fine to me. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:26, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Isn't the "In Sweden," in the blurb a bit redundant since "the Swedish parliament." comes later in the sentence? Also, Sweden's governing body isn't called parliament, it's called Riksdag. I think we use the correct name for a country's government. Better blubs would be: Magdalena Andersson, who resigned suddenly on November 24 after one day as PM-designate, is elected Prime Minister by the Swedish Riksdag. cart-Talk 14:49, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, so modified into Alt3 above, which YT now faves instead – tho Alt2 would still be OK. (More readers will understand "Swedish parliament" than "Riksdag.") – Sca (talk) 15:25, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Still a long and cumbersome blurb. Do we really put the party designation (Social Democrat) in head of government blurbs? That didn't come up before. (Do we say "Democrat Joe Biden"?) Also, "suddenly" isn't needed since the "one day" says it all, and it doesn't sound like an appropriate word to use here. Sounds too much like "Ooops, I dropped the PM position". New blurb added. cart-Talk 16:21, 30 November 2021 (UTC) By the way, all of these ALTs should probably use "24 November" not "November 24", as Sweden uses dmy not mdy according to sources on Date format by country. Joseph2302 (talk) 16:31, 30 November 2021 (UTC) If we are anglifying this and use 'parliament' instead of Riksdag, we might as well go all in and use mdy. cart-Talk 16:39, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Except mdy is not "anglifying", it's Americanising. Most of the English speaking world use dmy... Like England... Joseph2302 (talk) 16:45, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Allow me to point out that at the English Wikipedia we're not writing for Swedes (or for Rutabagas, either). – Sca (talk) 18:10, 30 November 2021 (UTC) A teapot tempest. If that's what's delaying this, let's just say "who resigned a week earlier after one day as PM-designate...." ("Suddenly" is rendered redundant by "After one day," etc.) OK? – Sca (talk) 17:41, 30 November 2021 (UTC) PS: – Cf. — Die Sozialdemokratin Magdalena Andersson (Bild) ist zum zweiten Mal innerhalb weniger Tage zur Ministerpräsidentin von Schweden gewählt worden. ("The Social Democrat Magdalena Andersson (pictured) has been elected Prime Minister of Sweden for the second time in a few days.") – Sca (talk) 17:50, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Nah, I think the delay is because ITN wants to give the Barbados blurb a bit more time as top spot. A far more important event than our (Swedish) teapot election squabbles. I don't mind, I can wait. :-) cart-Talk 17:57, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Speaking of Barbados, DYK that Rihanna gets in excess of 10,000 Wiki words? – Sca (talk) 18:14, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Support Andersson is officially the PM 1, 2 --Vacant0 (talk) 19:36, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Five hours on, it's high time to post this. Thanks. – Sca (talk) 23:03, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Posted. I used dmy instead of mdy as per the above.

She already claimed victory and some news outlets in Honduras are stating that she's virtually elected. Kacamata! Dimmi!!! 07:41, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Wait, Castro and Asfura have both claimed victory, and while Castro is clearly in the lead at the moment, nobody is certain how this election will turn out with such a volatile situation. I would support the blurb when counting has reached the point where it is undeniable that Castro has won and more than a few news outlets have acknowledged the win. Especially given that this would be the first time since 2009 where the National Party loses the presidency. For the time being though, its best we wait on such a contentious election. Ornithoptera (talk) 08:48, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Wait While it seems likely that Castro will win the election, considering the history here that is not a certainty. Additionally, her article could use some serious work, especially if she is to be a head of state. It's practically a stub! BSMRD (talk) 09:11, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Wait I don't see any sources saying Castro has been elected, even if he won the most votes. Also, how can we know a winner if only 50% of the votes are counted, that seems premature to call the election now? Also added a couple of cn tags which should be fixed. Joseph2302 (talk) 09:17, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Wait until final results are clear. The article needs improvement: cn tags, lack of prose in the preliminary results, missing at least the "Conduct" and "Aftermath" sections, and it would be great if the "Candidates" section would explain at least a little bit about the proposals of each one. And maybe talk a little more about the candidates to the National Congress and to the mayoralties, at least to the one in Tegucigalpa. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 10:18, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now and wait, way too early to call. Only 50% votes counted and both candidates have claimed victory. In the last election, Orlando caught up in the end to win (opposition was leading in the beginning). Oppose on the ground that we only nominate after a winner has been declared by the electoral comission. BastianMAT (talk) 10:34, 29 November 2021 (UTC) No, we don't wait the winner to be declared by the electoral commission. The most notorious case was the last US election. As soon as RS declares a candidate the winner we can publish it. Kacamata! Dimmi!!! 19:14, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Support Multiple RS reporting victory. Margin of win is significant. Maybe the blurb should state elected as first female president of Honduras. 99.247.176.90 (talk) 14:46, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Comment Apparently Asfura's National Party reportedly conceded defeat on 30 November 2021, meaning its almost certain that Castro will win.

Sucessful coup definitely. Troops or whatever actually made the move but was beaten back by loyal security forces probably.

Perhaps we need separate voting on article quality and readiness? --PFHLai (talk) 23:16, 26 November 2021 (UTC) To your first point, no. Everyone knows the formula for an RD blurb, whether they see it or not (national job description Someone Surname (pictured) dies at the age of x). That second idea is intriguing. InedibleHulk (talk) 06:51, 27 November 2021 (UTC) I don't understand how one can decide to support a blurb, or not support it, without knowing the vocabulary used for "national job description". I think Sunshineisles2's blurb got it right, though. --PFHLai (talk) 16:01, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: Proposed blurb, and I would additionally support blurb in principle when the article can be sufficiently improved. Few figures from the theatre world would qualify more than Sondheim as a transformative name in the field: the article leads on quoting the Medal of Freedom ceremony crediting him with "[reinventing] the American musical," there are theaters on both Broadway and the West End named after him, and there was literally a quarterly journal solely dedicated to his work that ran for over two decades.--Sunshineisles2 (talk) 23:20, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality until that's fixed, it's a moot point, as it can't go onto RD or ITN blurb unless it's sufficient quality. Joseph2302 (talk) 00:57, 27 November 2021 (UTC) No Blurb Big name in a big field, which will draw attention to itself in RD (pending article fixup). Nothing at all newsworthy about his age. Photo RD as an honorary gesture, if that's the goal. InedibleHulk (talk) 04:13, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Have we ever done a "photo RD"? Mlb96 (talk) 09:08, 27 November 2021 (UTC) No Once or twice, but that attitude didn't stop Stephen Sondheim from trying new nice things, c'mon! InedibleHulk (talk) 09:35, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Very occasionally: it's admittedly not a regular occurrence by any stretch. This is the most recent time I can think of, and it's been nearly two years. Though I wouldn't oppose a photo RD every once in a while.--Sunshineisles2 (talk) 14:36, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Mlb96 I tried it once - I was reverted and told I was crazy. I gave up at that point. Black Kite (talk) 11:40, 28 November 2021 (UTC) "Not going left, not going right"? Martinevans123 (talk) 11:48, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose blurb Of the theatre/film composers, Sondheim, Morricone and Williams are definitely at the top of the field and all deserve a blurb. However, considering that Morricone was dismissed for a blurb as an "old man", it'd be unjust to bypass it and give Sondheim a blurb (the same would be the case for Williams).--Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 07:45, 27 November 2021 (UTC) To be clear, the only reason I didn't say "old man dies" for this one was because I said OMD in the summary. Nothing personal. They were equally old and expressive in my books (and all subjectively beneath Carpenter, Elfman and Johnston). InedibleHulk (talk) 08:20, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Support blurb in principle A giant in the theatre world. Created so many masterworks, influenced so much culture. The top of his field. Passes the "Thatcher/Mandela" standard we sometimes use regarding world leader RDs. Transformational global leader. -TenorTwelve (talk) 07:52, 27 November 2021 (UTC) I agree. Although, in fact, only 5' 8"? Martinevans123 (talk) 10:47, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – (My 2¢) – I would oppose a blurb via the old-man-dies theme, but I don't know enough about his field to gauge 'transformativity.' Must admit he probably qualifies as a household name among the culturally aware – which, alas, may be a minority. – Sca (talk) 14:31, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Support blurb because of his prolific career at the top of his field. Him dying naturally as a nonagenarian doesn't disqualify him. Jim Michael (talk) 15:19, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Support either blurb or Photo RD in principle: ("in principle" because I leave others to judge quality). Sunshineisles2 has pointed out above that we posted this Photo RD 2 years ago. Basically something to mark the passing of a very notable individual, so either a blurb or a Photo RD.Tlhslobus (talk) 20:01, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Neutral, but why is his name not in the RD namelist already? -DePiep (talk) 20:57, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Some paras still without sources. Send in the cn tags? Martinevans123 (talk) 21:05, 27 November 2021 (UTC) How many "SUPPORT RD" votes so far? "in principle" does not count. --PFHLai (talk) 21:19, 27 November 2021 (UTC) No not the blurb. Just his name in the RD list. -DePiep (talk) 21:36, 27 November 2021 (UTC) As with Colin Powell: d. 18 Oct, only 20 Oct name in RD. -DePiep (talk) 21:43, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Because there are multiple paragraphs that lack a single reference. Stephen 22:04, 27 November 2021 (UTC) The WP:ITN/C § intro says: "A blurb needs ... target article ... check the quality of that article ... updated, ... reliable sources demonstrate the significance...": about quality for blurb article then. Then it says: "RD line ... can include any living thing whose death was recently announced". iow: no restriction by article quality for RD inclusion. Personally I find it reasonable that an article that was obviously BLP-conformant and that has an RS death announdement, can be linked to from RD. Anyway, an omittance, just as with Colin Powell (who was added to RD without blurp-quality articele— 2 days later b/c of similar blurb discussion). -DePiep (talk) 05:14, 28 November 2021 (UTC) We don’t post sub-standard biographies as a blurb or to recent deaths. Stephen 05:24, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Is what I am questioning. So far, only the blurb is explicitly mentioned for such a requirement. Also, I cannot find the reasoning that forces us to have such an omission on MP. -DePiep (talk) 05:32, 28 November 2021 (UTC) For any section on the Main Page (which includes ITN), any featured article is expected to demonstrate the quality with which WP editors can write. We don't expect FA quality for ITN featured items, but an article on an RD better be up to BLP specifications as a minimum standard, and that means large swathes of text missing sourcing is not a demonstration of our best work. --Masem (t) 05:37, 28 November 2021 (UTC) WP:ITNRD point 4 says "Of sufficient quality to be posted on the main page, as determined by a consensus of commenters." The linked section on article quality says, in part, "Articles should be well referenced; one or two "citation needed" tags may not hold up an article, but any contentious statements must have a source, and having entire sections without any sources is unacceptable." Thryduulf (talk) 14:44, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Support blurb One of the most notable living people in the theater world before his death. Blurb is warranted. Thriley (talk) 06:41, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Support blurb, top of the field. --Clibenfoart (talk) 09:16, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Note: Citations now improved. Any more required, or can this be posted? Martinevans123 (talk) 14:16, 28 November 2021 (UTC) There are still at least eight paragraphs without a single reference, and many more with content that isn’t sourced by refs present. So, not by a long shot. Kingsif (talk) 21:27, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Would you care to add appropriate cn tags, or even add a reference or two? Or perhaps you could improve "the tone"? Thanks so much. Martinevans123 (talk) 22:27, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Support blurb now. I respect the application of WP:BLPRS to this project. However, it's counterintuitive to demand further refinement of a very long, good article with 200 citations while posting other articles so short they barely pass AFD. GreatCaesarsGhost 22:37, 28 November 2021 (UTC) That's not a valid argument given that many of the CN tags are on opinions/subjective statements. Even if it had 1000 citations, having those CNs on those types of statements is a no-go for main page posting. --Masem (t) 02:39, 29 November 2021 (UTC) WP:BLPRS applies to the entire project, but most articles violate it. The elevated standard applied to ITN in its guidelines is not absolute, using words like "should" and "generally." The same language applies to proseline, but we never block on that basis alone. I agree the standard should be higher, but the measure of that standard remains the subjective opinion of the editors here. GreatCaesarsGhost 14:13, 29 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not sure who you are trying to argue with here; when it was posted the article had zero CN tags. As of my writing this, it still has zero CN tags. --Jayron32 14:17, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose So much tags. Hanamanteo (talk) 02:21, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Support RD or blurb Certainly top of his field; The NY Times describes him as a "titan of the American musical."

This new information is very important due to the mutations in the variant TapticInfo (talk) 20:06, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose we have COVID in ongoing. We have no real data other than how mutated this variant is. If it is the "end of days" variant, I'd support a blurb, but in the meantime, ongoing covers it well. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 20:21, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. I concur with TRM. I think every variant is concerning, but there isn't yet anything unusual about this one. 331dot (talk) 20:26, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Ok, a momentary pause: it is unusual in that the UK (for example) has already banned flights from southern Africa. No-one could land from there in the UK from midday today (and I know someone now stranded in Botswana as a result). So that is highly unusual. But it's purely precautionary based on what the UK didn't do with the delta variant. So there's a spectrum of "usualness". The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 20:29, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Support This is the first VOC since Delta (and we all know how that one turned out). Covid is on ongoing but this is I think a big enough update. Nixinova ??T ? C 20:57, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Wait The WHO said that it will take a few weeks to assess the impact. Until its impact becomes clear, it should stay off the front page. NW1223(Howl at me/My hunts) 20:53, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Comment. I wonder if the EU, US, UK and Canada imposing new travel bans on various African nations as a result of the new variant is noteworthy enough for the front page. Calidum 21:03, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Support. It took the WHO all of two days to dub this the first VOC since Delta in May, and every news site I've checked has Omicron as its top headline. --Xarm Endris (talk) 22:54, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Per TRM, 331. We have an Ongoing venue for Covid developments, and my impression is remains that not enough is known about this variant to warrant separate promotion at ITN. – Sca (talk) 23:19, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Support, this is headline news worldwide with major impact on travel, financial markets, etc. -- Tavix (talk) 23:38, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Confirmed cases already in Europe. This is an escalation. BabbaQ (talk) 23:49, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Lots of variants (including those that fizzled out) had confirmed cases in different countries in various parts of the world. As of now coverage about this variant is mostly speculation. 2607:FEA8:E31F:FBC1:2D79:6E12:60A:10C4 (talk) 15:25, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the article is written in British English, so why is the blurb being proposed with American spelling? Labeled is labelled in British English, which would be consistent with the article. This isn't American Wikipedia, no matter how much Americans want to whitewash the rest of the world. Joseph2302 (talk) 01:01, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Could you Assume Good Faith Joseph2302? No one is whitewashing anything; likely the author who proposed the blurb uses American English. I'd make the same mistake. Also, I dunno about the validity of "labeled" in British English, but in American English, "Labelled" is a valid (but less common) spelling.-- RockstoneSend me a message! 01:47, 27 November 2021 (UTC) I'll stop complaining when ITN stops getting spammed with Americanism. [4] shows my point on spellings. And we get way to many spurious, non notable ITN nominations about American stuff, compared to very little from other countries. Joseph2302 (talk) 03:07, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Well, this isn't an American story, so your complaint is irrelevant.

WaltCip-(talk) 14:28, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- this is getting attention that even the Delta variant did not get. It's the top headline worldwide (although, it is a slow news period since it's Thanksgiving/Black Friday weekend). -- RockstoneSend me a message! 01:48, 27 November 2021 (UTC) For about eight billion people worldwide, there'll be no figgy turkey and cheap electronics this weekend. Just headlines, everywhere, slowly repeating "Omicron". Omicron. InedibleHulk (talk) 04:00, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Support The existing ongoing doesn't provide anywhere near sufficient coverage in my opinion, with ctrl+f only finding the name of this variant used once. I second BabbaQ, the situation is escalating, significant, and merits separate coverage. Canadianerk (talk) 01:52, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Covered in ongoing; all we know is we don't know much yet, and like general COVID, learning more could take years. InedibleHulk (talk) 04:00, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Support several countries have already taken action in response to this variant. It is clearly highly newsworthy. Banedon (talk) 05:40, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Just as a possible alternative for the blurb, as there's nothing else on the Ongoing line presently, but this is a significant aspect to COVID we could add a parenthetical link to the Omicron variant page in Ongoing, assuming that that target is of quality. --Masem (t) 06:02, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Altblurbed If anyone knows how many those "several" are in real numbers, feel free to fill me in. I still oppose both blurbs. Just think this one is less routine advisory, more headline. InedibleHulk (talk) 06:19, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This new variant has a large probability of becoming a new pandemic, COVID-21 that will exist parallel to COVID-19. So, we're then back to square one. If we then repeat the same mistake of not containing COVID-21 using strict lockdowns like the Chinese did in Wuhan, we'll end up with the same outcome a few years later: COVID-23 and back to square one yet again. Count Iblis (talk) 06:55, 27 November 2021 (UTC) None of that somewhat alarming and rather sound advice is in the blurbs or target article, though...yet.

Jehochman Talk 13:43, 27 November 2021 (UTC) ITN isn't a forum for probabilities of any size, however many alarums may divert us from editorial probity. – Sca (talk) 14:57, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Support Now this is definately IN THE NEWS — Preceding unsigned comment added by 5.44.170.26 (talk) 08:12, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose This is a WP:MEDRS matter and so unsuitable for ITN which posts uncited blurbs on a highly visible but protected page. The news is quite tentative and based on a press-release rather than solid science. The WHO statements are not consistent – that the variant is concerning but that measures such as travel bans should not be used and that we should use the alphabet to avoid stigma but not follow its order to avoid Xi. It appears that the variant will not be well understood for at least two weeks and so we will have to wait for reliable information. See also mu. Andrew?(talk) 08:51, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Variant of concern is a formal designation, and we have posted medical news plenty of times before (e.g. when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic; I'll save folks the embarrassment of digging up who opposed that one) in addition to medical TFA blurbs, so I don't think your argument that we should avoid anything MEDRS on the main page has precedent. {{u|Sdkb}}?talk 18:45, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Add to ongoing where COVID-19 is already listed. Yes places have suspended flights, but they've been doing this on and off for almost 2 years now. And it's based more on the fact they don't know enough about this variant. ALT0 is dull and doesn't explain why this needs posting, when no other variant did. ALT1 is a knee-jerk reaction to countries not knowing enough about it, that will likely be recinded in a couple of weeks. And not sure the article meets WP:MEDRS either. Joseph2302 (talk) 09:09, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose per all above. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 09:27, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Very widely reported on Saturday, with suspected cases in The Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. However, vaccine makers say tweaked Covid vaccines could be developed quickly against the Omnicron variant. [5] In the circumstances, it's too early to play Omnicron as a blurb. – Sca (talk) 13:16, 27 November 2021 (UTC) This new virus is actually mentioned all over the news. And confirmed cases is starting to be reported daily.BabbaQ (talk) 13:34, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Seems to me I've encountered the phrase "all over" all over the place lately. – Sca (talk) 15:16, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Skeptical because there is only suspicion at this point. Nothing is actually known other than that there's a new variant of concern. Unfortunately science does not lend itself to breaking news. Rather, it's a long slow progression. This can be covered in ongoing. We should not chase the latest COVID speculation, much of which eventually proves to be wrong. WHO has named 5 variants of concern, but only Alpha and Delta appear to have become dominant in their time. We do not know if Omicron will be another Delta, or if it will go the way of Gamma. How many times have we previously posted a WHO announcement about a variant of concern? If we didn't post the last five, why should we post this one? As for the alternative blurb, is the travel disruption between southern Africa and the rest of the world significant enough, or is it just more the same that's been happening here and there for the last 18 months (which would suggests this should be covered in ongoing). Jehochman Talk 13:37, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose, per TRM above. —Brigade Piron (talk) 13:39, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Support because travel between many countries has been severely adversely affected. The news of the variant caused a huge fall in the oil price & stock markets on Fri. Jim Michael (talk) 15:21, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Support Even if it turns out to be fairly harmless it has already caused significant disruption, including the cancellation of a major WTO conference in Geneva, etc. Tlhslobus (talk) 20:20, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose per Jehochman above. Unfortunately the news here is not what's IN the news, but the fact that so many ill-informed people are getting stressed and excited about something they know so little about. HiLo48 (talk) 21:42, 27 November 2021 (UTC) It's not our role to judge whether the top headlines were chosen appropriately. And I'd argue that a new variant that could prolong the pandemic, potentially leading to millions of deaths and billions in economic losses, is absolutely a story that deserves to be getting the attention it has, even if we don't know everything yet. {{u|Sdkb}}?talk 18:45, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Support. Like it or not, Omicron is THE biggest story in the world right now and that will continue to be the case for a while. Even if it turns out that the variant is not vaccine resistant, the real world implications in terms of the response by many countries have been major, and there will be further discussions either way about what to do next, including likely implications for speeding up vaccine distribution to the developing countries. We should post items to ITN based on what's actually happening rather than on what we'd like people to think. Nsk92 (talk) 01:08, 28 November 2021 (UTC) As I hinted at above, the news here is not so much the existence of this variant, but the fact that so many ill-informed people are getting stressed and excited about something they know so little about. HiLo48 (talk) 05:10, 28 November 2021 (UTC) I follow the experts that says that the new variant is highly dangerous and even have basically closed down the UK and South Africa. Excited? come on.BabbaQ (talk) 09:25, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Indeed, as we can read here: "The variant harbors a high number of mutations in regions of the spike protein that antibodies recognize, potentially dampening their potency. “Many mutations we know are problematic, but many more look like they are likely contributing to further evasion,” says Moore. There are even hints from computer modelling that B.1.1.529 could dodge immunity conferred by another component of the immune system called T cells, says Moore.....Moore says breakthrough infections have been reported in South Africa among people who have received any of the three kinds of vaccines in use there, from Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer–BioNTech and Oxford–AstraZeneca. Two quarantined travellers in Hong Kong who have tested positive for the variant were vaccinated with the Pfizer jab, according to news reports. One individual had travelled from South Africa; the other was infected during hotel quarantining." Count Iblis (talk) 09:40, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Did they get severe disease, hospitalization, and death? That is what actually matters, not mild / asymptomatic infections. There were lots of cases of mild breakthrough infections with other variants. 2607:FEA8:E31F:FBC1:2D79:6E12:60A:10C4 (talk) 15:34, 28 November 2021 (UTC) If omicron escapes immunity and spreads better than delta, then this will cause the number of omicron cases to explode but without it replacing the delta variant, because immunity against omicron does not lead to immunity against delta. So, we'll then have two parallel pandemics. Because Delta alone causes capacity problems at hospitals, omicron doesn't need to be worse than delta. If it spreads more rapidly than delta, then even with a smaller hospitalization rate you can still get a huge peak in hospitalizations. Even if it is so benign that such a peak is relatively small, this will still add to the hospitalized delta-variant patients, so even in that case it will be bad news. Count Iblis (talk) 15:59, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Any claim that it is a complete vaccine escape variant is speculation. Lots of people said the same about earlier variants like the mu variant and beta variant, there was a drop in neutralization effectiveness but the vaccine was still effective. 2607:FEA8:E31F:FBC1:2D79:6E12:60A:10C4 (talk) 16:28, 28 November 2021 (UTC) A suggestion to those who support posting this: try reframing the blurb. The news here is not a science story, but it might be a social story about governments panicking (or grandstanding) after being burned before. Unfortunately the travel bans will solve nothing because this variant has already dispersed, and the variant doesn't care whether somebody is a citizen of one country or another. (The travel bans have exemptions allowing expatriates to return home.) If it's bad, it's going to trigger another wave. If it's not that bad, then this is much ado about nothing. We cannot know at this time which scenario will follow. Jehochman Talk 13:30, 28 November 2021 (UTC) There is now an altblurb to that effect, but the problem is that there are a large number of small consequences, which arguably justify posting collectively but probably not individually (the current altblurb is mentioning what arguably looks like "just another travel ban, which happen all the time"), and it's seemingly hard to phrase an altblurb to say this acceptably. Tlhslobus (talk) 18:08, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Coverage about this variant is mostly speculation. Not everything is bad, for instance there are preliminary reports that this variant tends to produce less severe infections (like the other stuff, this is preliminary, it will take time to confirm or disprove). Many of the support votes are speculating, see WP:CRYSTAL. 2607:FEA8:E31F:FBC1:2D79:6E12:60A:10C4 (talk) 15:30, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Time to close? I'm a 'Support' but, if I have not miscounted, I make the current count 13 Supports to 11 Opposes (counting the Skeptical and Add to Ongoing as Opposes), so seemingly not much likelihood of a 2 to 1 Supermajority for posting, and closing may help editors focus their efforts on more productive work. Tlhslobus (talk) 18:08, 28 November 2021 (UTC) An unsuccessful close would be yet another piece of evidence that In the News is utterly incapable of actually posting news. There is a slim majority supporting, but this is not a vote, and I think the opposes are largely uncompelling: they say it's just speculation, ignoring the fact that just the reaction to the speculation alone is notable enough to be the top headline worldwide. {{u|Sdkb}}?talk 18:45, 28 November 2021 (UTC) One more oppose, per Andrew, TRM.

And blurb seems incorrect, as Australia were invited in, they didn't take over. Joseph2302 (talk) 03:03, 27 November 2021 (UTC) I used the term "take over" because that's the term used by Reuters and Australian Financial Review. I added an alt blurb for clarification.Scaramouche33 (talk) 06:10, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Sadly the AFR is now owned by Rupert Murdoch, a man who has always had a stronger interest in stirring political troubles rather than reporting facts. Using it as a source is little better than using Fox "News". Reuters may well have simply copied the language used the AFR. HiLo48 (talk) 21:46, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I expanded the Background section to include economic factors.

There is more than enough continuing international coverage e.g WaPo, CNN, NYT, Al Jazeera, Guardian, etc. The intervention of Australian troops already makes it much more than an internal unrest story. Plus most of the properties burned are apparently China owned businesses and there are likely to be implications for China's Belt and Road projects in the Solomon Islands. Nsk92 (talk) 02:21, 28 November 2021 (UTC) The Australian Federal Police is NOT Australian troops.

And we need different sources. HiLo48 (talk) 07:29, 28 November 2021 (UTC) CNN explicitly says that both Australian police and Defense Force have been deployed. Nsk92 (talk) 10:43, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Then the proposed blurb is wrong. HiLo48 (talk) 21:45, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Neutral on Posting, but, if we do post, Support Altblurb (or variants) and Oppose Blurb: The blurb makes it look like "Australian Imperialism", which it seemingly isn't (although it may well eventually come to be perceived as such by many, as happened, for instance, with British intervention in Northern Ireland in 1969, and with the Indian intervention in Sri Lanka that eventually led to Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, but we're not in the Crystal Ball business). I may or may not add an altblurb that mentions the Australian Defence Forces per above discussion, although the altblurb may then get a bit long.Tlhslobus (talk) 19:05, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Support: Switching from neutral on posting to Support, after giving further thought to the geopolitical aspects, as this seems to be a clear instance of Sino-US rivalry in action.

Quite a bit of in-depth coverage of both the election and the run-up to it in international media. 15 (talk) 14:36, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Needs work The election is in the news as I heard a radio bulletin about it myself. But the article needs work as it's currently too much about the controversy with not enough about the man for a biography. For example, I find that he wrote Social & Security Impact of the Internet but the article says nothing about that. I wonder what it says about Wikipedia... Andrew?(talk) 09:32, 26 November 2021 (UTC) I thought about including the book you link, but it was published by a governmental security think tank, so I'm not sure about it's quality and DUEness.

Article: Murder of Ahmaud Arbery (talk · history · tag) Blurb: All three men, George McMichael, Travis McMichael, and William Bryan Jr., are found guilty in the Murder of Ahmaud Arbery (Post) News source(s): CNN, The New York Times BBC Credits: Nominated by Andise1 (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: Ending to a major court case related to racial issues in the US. Andise1 (talk) 20:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Is it really necessary to discuss such a case again? I refer to here. Yet another case with zero international impact and interest, yet another case of a purely local trial. Far from being akin to the conviction for the murder of George Floyd. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alsoriano97 If "international impact" was required for postings, very little would be posted. 331dot (talk) 20:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, but it should be much more decisive when it comes to court rulings than in other cases (sports, science, elections...). If the follow-up of a trial has a very low international coverage/interest, will you tell me that it's not an important requirement to take into account when determining whether a court case is blurb-worthy or not? So many people are condemned every day in this world... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Respectfully, we aren't talking about someone convicted of robbing the corner store, but a black man who was murdered basically for being in the wrong neighborhood in a part of the United States where convictions for this sort of thing are rare. And as I said, this incident has influenced changes in laws. 331dot (talk) 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, laws of a single U.S. state (as far as I know). If it were at the federal level I might come to support it, but not at this one. And many are the events that trigger legislative changes. And without a doubt, the article is in excellent shape. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 22:35, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This was a highly followed trial in the US, and even before the verdict this incident resulted in changes in Georgia law(the elimination of citizens' arrests). 331dot (talk) 20:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Article is also of decent quality from what I can see. 331dot (talk) 20:57, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- this verdict is likely to influence future trials of this type in the United States, and it is an historic decision in an area of the country known for its virulent racism. I doubt a jury would have reached this verdict in that area even 20 years ago. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support High profile case with notable legal impact, quality article. SpencerT•C 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This is a newsworthy verdict, and the article is in good shape from a skim-through. -- Tavix (talk) 21:56, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose people found guilty of crime that they themselves were stupid enough to video. Seriously. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:18, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose It's gotten a lot of attention for emotional reasons, and on a human level the crime was shocking. But its long-term significance is likely to be minimal. People are murdered every day all over the world. Some get a lot of press attention. We almost never post them. -Ad Orientem (talk) 22:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's already had long term significance, both legally and perhaps socially. This was not a garden variety murder. I don't understand this line of thinking more generally. If this event is not notable due to not having "long term significance", it should be proposed for deletion. 331dot (talk) 22:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all, there does exist a middle ground between ITN and AFD. This is a prime example. It's the result of a clear-cut murder case which the perps videoed themselves. A no-brainer. What would have been newsworthy would have been this ending in a non-guilty verdict and the no-doubt ensuing riots. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:34, 24 November 2021 (UTC) They taped it because they were in their mind attempting to make a citizens arrest(which was banned after this incident) even though they had no evidence of a crime. And in Georgia and elsewhere this is, rightly or wrongly, not clear cut. Even 15 years ago these men might have got off. And there was doubt Derek Chauvin would be convicted for killing George Floyd even though that was on video. 331dot (talk) 22:45, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, it's nuanced and emotive but ultimately it's just another crime story. It's been whipped up with publicity and is precisely the reason that we need to apply some common sense to these kinds of nominations. It is of minimal long term significance. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:49, 24 November 2021 (UTC) If this crime had occurred in the 1960s or earlier with the same verdict, I'd support posting due to its obvious significance. But it's not 1961. It's 2021 and in this day and age racial lynchings, when they happen, typically end up with long jail sentences. The man was murdered. His killers were tried and convicted in open court. Where's the long term significance? Again, this is not 1961 where there would have been a great deal of shock at this outcome. -Ad Orientem (talk) 23:35, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Then it should be proposed for deletion. I am going to now withdraw from this discussion as I am finding it frustrating that we are drifting away from our mission here. This is on me and me alone, no one else. 331dot (talk) 23:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think there is any question that this passes WP:EVENT and GNG. But ITN has traditionally had higher standards for posting events. -Ad Orientem (talk) 03:31, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly right. There is a middle ground between AFD and ITN, and this article falls squarely in there. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 07:54, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is in good shape, well referenced, and story is currently being adequately covered by reliable sources. Meets all requirements. --Jayron32 22:38, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Similar to the Rittenhouse verdict - limited notability, outcome that isn't nationally or globally significant in any game-changing or important way. Prism55 (talk) 23:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose This wasn't a case with the same scope as the George Floyd killing , it had no ties to terrorism and did not create any major unrest from the original event (nor the verdict), and outside of the event, none of these people are notable. This is the type of thing we absolutely should NOT be posting to ITN. --Masem (t) 23:51, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I vehemently disagree with the idea that there must be global protests and riots in order to post a highly notable criminal conviction. We are supposed to follow the news at least somewhat and we have a great article to feature. 331dot (talk) 23:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This isn't a notable criminal conviction - all parties involved are BLP1E. It's a highly-covered story, but given the bias our sources have towards US-based stories, this is not a surprise. And no, we're not supposed to follow the news - we aren't a news ticker. That's what the Current Events page is for. --Masem (t) 23:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose this kind of case is fairly common in the US. The focus tends to be on race, not on the facts of the case or the law. If the focus were on the last, then perhaps the law might change in which case there is a long-term impact; since it isn't, if we post this we might as well put "bias in the United States legal system" or some similar article into ongoing. Banedon (talk) 02:18, 25 November 2021 (UTC) The law did change in Georgia in response Arbery's murder. The Georgia legislature repealed their statute allowing for citizen's arrest. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 03:11, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Hmm. It's still only one state though. I would prefer to see something at country level. Banedon (talk) 03:24, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Every Black Lives Matter adjacent case isn’t news for the In The News section, unless we come to a consensus that Black Lives Matter should be given special consideration for the section. Trillfendi (talk) 04:40, 25 November 2021 (UTC) No, we shouldn't be doing that, as it's a WP:BIAS towards American news stories. Joseph2302 (talk) 10:43, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose we don't need to post every murder verdict on ITN. If this wasn't an American murder trial, it wouldn't even be considered here.

This article is inflated by an overly long background section with tangential relevance to this event (and which is covered in the article on the wider issue anyway), and too many reactions for an article of this size.

Nominator's comments: ITNR, as it falls under "Changes in the holder of the office which administer the executive of their respective state/government, in those countries which qualify under the criteria above, as listed at List of current heads of state and government except when that change was already posted as part of a general election". First female prime minister of Sweden. BastianMAT (talk) 09:59, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment she takes office on the 26th (according to her article). Until that point, the blurb isn't correct, as she only becomes the first female PM of Sweden on that date. Is it usual to post when it's announced, or when they take office? Joseph2302 (talk) 10:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Usually when they are elected but yeah with the blurb of being elected. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support - First female PM in Sweden. But change blurb to ”is elected” instead becomes.BabbaQ (talk) 10:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Significant as new PM and first female. Perhaps the blub should be "elected by the Riksdag" since she didn't gain office through a normal election (by the people). cart-Talk 10:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) That's normal in a parliamentary system. – Sca (talk) 15:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should probably start with "Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, ..." to provide context, since this was not an election outcome but a government reshuffle. --Tone 10:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support now the blurb has been changed to "is elected" seems fine to run now. Agree with Tone that we should make it clearer that this wasn't an election that caused this. Joseph2302 (talk) 11:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Her article looks great, is ITNR and altblurb, although somewhat long, it's the most complete and clear of all. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Posting. --Tone 11:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Would suggest that we use the image of Andersson at the front page.BabbaQ (talk) 11:49, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Agree with this, we usually use the image for the newest blurb. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:32, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Post-posting support This is historic. -TenorTwelve (talk) 14:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Since Sweden's in the EU, perhaps she'll become the next Merkel. – Sca (talk) 15:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Then again, maybe not. – Sca (talk) 20:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update by the nominator Things are looking bad for her and her party now. The Center Party (liberal) voted for the opposition’s budget and it got through. The Center party did not agree with the goverment’s budget, stating it was way too left. That would mean Magdallena now has to rule with right wing economic politics, which she accepted. However their junior party the Green party did not accept it and have left the goverment meaning a new Riksdag election for the prime minister post shall be held. Interesting development. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update 2 by nominator Magdallena Andersson has officially resigned. We might have to pull the news back as she won’t be assuming office. She will only assume office if she wins a new prime minister vote, which might take place in a few days/weeks, depending on how the talks with the speaker goes. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull (or update the blurb). Her resignation is quickly making international news. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 17:38, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update blurb Move over Kim Campbell, there's a new sheriff in town. Or more precisely, there was one for a few hours.Scaramouche33 (talk) 17:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull until it's confirmed whether she will now be the leader or not. Joseph2302 (talk) 18:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull What is ITNR is that a few hours ago she has been elected by the Swedish parliament. However much she has resigned. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 18:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) What updating with "and immediately resigns" or something? This is a really weird sequence of events. --Tone 18:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull - The blurb, as it currently stands, is false.--WaltCip-(talk) 18:50, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Updated to Magdalena Andersson (pictured), shortly after being elected as the first female prime minister of Sweden, resigns. Any further changes, please? --PFHLai (talk) 19:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I think this is fine now. --Tone 19:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not a big fan of blurbs that contemplate the resignation of a prime minister...But knowing a bit of precedent, it's very likely that in a few days/weeks she will be re-elected, as happened with Löfven in the middle of this year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 19:48, 24 November 2021 (UTC) For the record, I support this new blurb. It will work until she is finally elected the new PM in a few days or at the longest a week.BabbaQ (talk) 20:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Hopefully, we'll have an update about her taking office soon. That would be a simple update to do. --PFHLai (talk) 20:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull -- wait until she actually is seated. She just resigned. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:22, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The blurb already says that. It's fine. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's probably just my own bias here; but it seems silly to post this when she just resigned. Forming coalition governments in a parliamentary system is weird. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:45, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's a fascinating and encyclopedic story. Unlike the myriad legal cases being spewed out of the US these days. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support new/current blurb ("Magdalena Andersson resigns shortly after being elected as the first female prime minister of Sweden.") The story remains encyclopedic and newsworthy. Chrisclear (talk) 07:57, 25 November 2021 (UTC) (Posted) Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART)[edit] Article: Double Asteroid Redirection Test (talk · history · tag) Blurb: NASA launches DART – the first attempt to change the course of an asteroid (pictured) (Post) Alternative blurb: The Double Asteroid Redirection Test spacecraft is launched on a mission to the asteroid Didymos and its moon Dimorphos (artist's impression pictured) Alternative blurb II: The Double Asteroid Redirection Test spacecraft is launched on a mission to attempt to deflect the course of the asteroid Dimorphos (artist's impression pictured) News source(s): BBC, Guardian, NYT Credits: Nominated by Andrew Davidson (talk · give credit) Created by Frmorrison (talk · give credit) Updated by CRS-20 (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: There's going to be a follow-up launching in 2024 and arriving in 2027 so it's quite a long-term plan. But it's in the news now. Andrew?(talk) 08:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important mission with global implications, good article. Polyamorph (talk) 08:18, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment. This may be notable as the first mission of its type (to post now); it will be ITNR when it arrives as well. Just saying. 331dot (talk) 08:19, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This may be ITN/R per "first ... launches of any type of rocket" as it's the first mission to use the NEXT drive but that's debatable. Andrew?(talk) 10:09, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The NEXT is the thruster on the spacecraft, not the rocket that put it up there(a Falcon 9). 331dot (talk) 12:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Such missions usually have multiple stages and each stage has separate rocket engines. The first stage is usually more spectacular but there's no scientific reason to prefer it. For deep space missions lasting years, the efficiency of the final spacecraft will be most important and this is a new design. Andrew?(talk) 12:54, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important global mission (even if it does sound like DART is copying the plot of Salvation (TV series)). Added 3 cn tags to article, but apart from that, it looks more than good enough article quality for the front page. Joseph2302 (talk) 09:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Everyone in the world should be happy we'll finally have a way to stop any doomsday asteroids from wiping us all out. Dream Focus 11:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) If it works, of course... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support is ITNR from what Andrew says and the global impact of this mission is undoubted, so it's clearly notable. In fact I think it should be one of the most important scientific news of the year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Global impact?? I thought the idea was to avoid that! Martinevans123 (talk) 13:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This event can't be notable, its only impact is on a small unpopulated asteroid! WaltCip-(talk) 14:17, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Impactfulness nonapparent at this pt. in time & space. – Sca (talk) 15:00, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the proposed blurb is a mess. I've added alt1, though for some reason that's messing up the template formatting - I can't work out why. Modest Genius talk 13:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, this is not ITNR, as it's not a new type of rocket and interplanetary probes are ITNR when they arrive at their destination, not when launched. But the gap here is long enough (ten months) that it's reasonable to post both launch and arrival. Modest Genius talk 13:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) @Modest Genius: I fixed the formatting issue. Adding italics to either of the blurbs breaks it, because italics are already applied by default.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The fact that the mission is attempting to alter the course of the asteroid makes this particularly notable. Added alt2. Polyamorph (talk) 13:40, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alt2 is incorrect. It won't 'deflect the course' of the asteroid. The impact will modify orbit of the moon around the asteroid, not either of their orbits around the Sun. Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Dimorphos is an asteroid (albeit a minor one compared to Didymos). It will deflect its course. Nothing to do with the Sun. Polyamorph (talk) 13:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It may deflect its course. – Sca (talk) 15:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It will deflect it, even if by only a negligible amount. But this is covered by the wording of alt2 "on a mission to attempt to deflect the course". Polyamorph (talk) 15:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – From what I've seen, this is such a complicated, long-term project that any significant results may be years off. – Sca (talk) 13:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - no mention of Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck or Michael Bay. But seriously Support, though I'd recommend that gallery be trimmed down. --Masem (t) 15:03, 24 November 2021 (UTC) You forgot to mention Taylor Swift. – Sca (talk) 15:07, 24 November 2021 (UTC) @Sca: You mean Liv Tyler :) Brandmeistertalk 20:05, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Guess I spaced her out. – Sca (talk) 15:06, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Support ALT2 Very significant, and definitely should be in ITN. Heythereimaguy (talk) 17:36, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support ALT2 – significant, interesting science story. Can "artist's impression pictured" go in the caption not the blurb? User:GKFXtalk 23:22, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support ALT2 Nice addition to the news . --Frmorrison (talk) 00:59, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Posted Stephen 01:47, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Very Strong Post-Posting Support - This mission on its own arguably justifies all humankind's entire space budgets to date, and I only heard about it because it was on our front page (I missed most news stories yesterday for medical reasons). Thanks, Wikipedia, and thanks also to all the editors who contributed to the article and its posting.
