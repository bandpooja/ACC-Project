Further information: Official supplementary guidelines and unofficial guide Nominate an article Script instructions[edit] Or you can install this script: Warning: You are not logged in. Please create an account or log in to proceed. Alternatively, you may leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose. Warning: The helper script only works on desktop. Please switch to desktop view to continue. Install the DYK helper script by adding the line {{subst:lusc|User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js}} to your common.js page. Go back to the article, and choose the "DYK" option from the "More" menu (see image). Fill in the form and submit it. Check back periodically to address comments or concerns from the reviewer (it may take several weeks). Frequently asked questions[edit] How do I write an interesting hook? Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook. When will my nomination be reviewed? This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Where is my hook? If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Instructions for reviewers[edit] Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide. To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below: Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on. Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage. The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria. To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened. If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING :* --> showing you where you should put the comment. Save the page. If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page. Instructions for project members[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a Prep area See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability. Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day. Check list for nomination review completeness 1) Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post: . 2) Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed. a. Any outstanding issue following needs to be addressed before promoting. 3) Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed. 4) Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot. 5) Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated). 6) Hook should make sense grammatically. 7) Try to vary subject matters within each prep area. 8) Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set. Steps to add a hook to prep In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote. In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. 1) For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on DYK Queue. a. Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number. 2) Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot. a. Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end. b. Check that there's a bold link to the article. 3) If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template. 4) Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom 5) Check your work in the prep's Preview mode. a. At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake. 6) Save the Prep page. Closing the DYK nomination page At the upper left Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage Change |passed= to |passed=yes At the bottom Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.--> insert a new, separate line containing one of the following: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] Also paste the same thing into the edit summary. Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom. Save. For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook. Handy copy sources: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] How to remove a rejected hook[edit] Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.) In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes. How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit] Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page. Nominations[edit] Older nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 27[edit] Roman campaigns in Germania (12 BC – AD 16) ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes following the disaster at Teutoburg, but decided to leave Germany because its land was not considered valuable? Source: Wells (2003), The Battle That Stopped Rome, pp. 206–7 Improved to Good Article status by SpartaN (talk). Self-nominated at 03:34, 29 September 2021 (UTC). General eligibility: New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Other problems: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: Y Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: Y Hook eligibility: Cited: N - Source is offline but happy to AGF. However, in the article the statement “they considered German lands too poor for annexation” is sourced to p.204 of Wells. pp.206-7 referred to above is used to support that they that “it was too costly in economic and military resources” to go into in Germany. I guess either way the hook is sourced but could you clarify the exact sourcing of the hook. Interesting: Y QPQ: None required. Overall: Interesting thorough article, well-written with good quality sourcing. Earwig shows no issues. Just a minor query around the hook sourcing but otherwise will be good to go. DeCausa (talk) 08:23, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @DeCausa: I found the web link that (for me) shows a preview if you're able to see it: https://books.google.com/books?id=mc30CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206 SpartaN (talk) 10:07, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN: Thanks for providing the link. It’s prompted a couple of thoughts for me. Firstly, Wells doesn’t seem to be saying the reason for the withdrawal is definitively known (“… the reasons for these decisions must have lain…”) i.e he’s making an assumption, however well founded. The hook is more definite than Wells is. Secondly, Wells’ emphasis is on the strength of the resistance being behind the reason - the poor value of the territory makes it “not worth it” because of the strength of the resistance. That’s not quite the same as just saying the land wasn’t valuable. (I notice the text you used in the article on this reflects that effort/value ratio issue.) To fix both points would you be prepared to consider an ALT1 which after “…Teutoburg” continues something along the lines of “…likely decided to leave Germany because the military effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value?” although there may need to be some trimming to get it into the 200 character limit. DeCausa (talk) 11:12, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN and DeCausa: It's been over a month since the last comments here, have there been any updates? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:31, 13 November 2021 (UTC) From my point of view I’m waiting for SpartaN’s reply to my last post here. But I notice they haven’t edited Wikipedia since then, over a month ago. So I’m not quite sure what can be done. DeCausa (talk) 08:17, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I see. Given that there's really only one issue holding the nomination back, would anyone be willing to adopt this in case SpartaN doesn't return? It would be a shame if the nomination failed at this point. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:35, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I’m not sure what exactly are the DYK rules on this but, subject to that, options could be (a) I propose an ALT1 hook and someone else signs it off; (b) someone else proposes an ALT1 hook and I sign it off; (c) if anyone disagrees with me on the original hook I’m happy to step away and they sign it off. DeCausa (talk) 11:04, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I've looked at the Wells source and concur that it is saying the withdrawal was more down to the ratio of effort required to potential reward, and have boldly tweaked the copy in the article to reflect this. For what it's worth, I think ALT1 works just fine. firefly ( t · c ) 11:16, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Ok. I’m just going to formalize the ALT1 and let someone else add the tick and sign off: ALT1:... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes after the disaster at Teutoburg but likely decided to leave Germany as the effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value? DeCausa (talk) 12:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Since the reviewer has proposed a new hook, another editor will be needed to sign this off. I'm not sure though if the section linking in the bold links is allowed, however. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 15 November 2021 (UTC) sorry, I missed that. It’s not even necessary to link to a section of the article so I’ve taken it out of ALT1. DeCausa (talk) 08:21, 15 November 2021 (UTC) As this doesn’t seem to be moving I’m going to give ALT1 the tick as original reviewer. If the DYK regulars think this is out of process because I came up nwith ALT1 then happy for it to be reverted. DeCausa (talk) 22:46, 21 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa, there is no rush to approve, and your approval of your own hook was indeed out of process. I have reverted SL93's promotion of the nomination to prep, and with any luck a new reviewer will be around soon enough to review your ALT1. (SL93, you're welcome to review it, but that means you cannot also promote it.) I've also struck the original hook due to the issues noted above. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) BlueMoonset Sorry for mixing up who approved it. SL93 (talk) 04:26, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't notice the second sentence of the approval...not sure how that happened. Sorry, again. SL93 (talk) 04:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa Reading through the article again, your ALT1 hook seems to be mostly verifed in the Aftermath section, but I'm not seeing any indication of it being "likely". SL93 (talk) 21:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, that’s true. Where that came from was, in the above discussion with SpartaN on the original hook, they cited Wells in support. Wells says, in relation to Tiberius’ decision to ‘give up’, that “The reason for these decisions must have lain in the Germans’ tough resistance”. I’ve taken that to mean Wells’ was inferring Tiberius’ reasoning without direct evidence (or certainty) of Tiberius’ actual reason. However, you’re right that the way the article is written is more certain. I’m ok striking the “likely” or, possibly it would be better to amend the final sentence of the first paragraph of the Aftermath section to be more reflectve of Wells. DeCausa (talk) 21:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I will leave this here for someone else to look at. It would be helpful if the nominator came back. SL93 (talk) 23:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on October 9[edit] Pankratius Pfeiffer ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that Salvatorian priest Pankratius Pfeiffer saved hundreds of Jews in Rome during the Second World War? Reviewed: 1936 Northeast Flood Created by Ergo Sum (talk). Self-nominated at 17:52, 9 October 2021 (UTC). New article that was created on 9 October 2021? is 3,212 characters and nominated on the same day. No copyvios detected and duplication detector of [1][2][3][4][5] reveal no close paraphrasing issues (AGF PDF docs which can't go through Dup detector). Article is well-sourced. Hook is 103 characters long (under 200 character max.) and is interesting. Refs 4 and 5 (verifying the hook) are reliable sources. QPQ done. Looks good to go! —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:41, 9 October 2021 (UTC) Too many red flags here. If he really saved hundreds of Jews, you would expect plenty of confirmation of this in scholarly sources and him to be recognized by Yad Vashem. I can't count the number of times that I've seen mainstream newspapers print completely false stories about Jews being rescued during the holocaust, so better sources are definitely needed to confirm these extraordinary claims. Thanks Brigade Piron for letting me know about this. (t · c) buidhe 16:51, 10 October 2021 (UTC) I have to admit I'm just a bit perplexed by the argument. Except in fairly uncommon cases of multiple RS that contradict each other, we don't generally recognize any "hierarchy" of reliable sources. Sources are either RS or they are not. So I'm not sure what kind of sources you have in mind as "better" sources. The ones currently cited in the article are all RS, so that should be the end of it. I might add that if you seek some manner of official imprimatur in the vein of Yad Vashem, the City of Rome named a street after him. Your point about why there isn't more extensive coverage of this historical figure is well taken but can easily be attributed to the fact that all manner of historical figures are lost to history, especially those who are notable really for one major event in their life that did not come to light until years later, as is the case here. Indeed, one of the RS in this article describes Pfeiffer as being "lost to history." I'm adding the new review icon here so that we can get at least one more editor's evaluation of this. Ergo Sum 13:32, 16 October 2021 (UTC) There are very few people who actually saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust and plenty of hoaxes that were reported as truth by various news organizations—for example Necdet Kent. In other cases, actual rescue did occur but the numbers are greatly exaggerated and repeated uncritically by news organizations, such as Raoul Wallenberg. If the story is true you would expect to see it covered in many more credible sources. There are plenty of cases where a source is reliable for some info but not others. For example, someone's CV is often reliable for "they worked at X organization" but not "they are a world expert in Z". Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sourcing. (t · c) buidhe 21:27, 16 October 2021 (UTC) I should say that I share Buidhe's concerns. I think saying that "all manner of historical figures are lost to history" rather side-steps the sheer volume of historical scholarship on all aspects of the Holocaust. On a more banal note, I think part of the problem is that the sources cited are, essentially, all journalistic sources published by explicitly Catholic or Salvatorian outlets. The specific sources cited for the "saved" claim are Romereports (I am not familiar with this outlet, but the typo in the video does not inspire confidence) and a self-published Salvatorian newsletter. Neither are scholarly sources and both are, again, explicitly confessional in nature. I think WP:BIASED may on point in a highly sensitive issue touching on the wider disputes about Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. Do we know what the Samerski book says, for example? —Brigade Piron (talk) 08:55, 17 October 2021 (UTC) Buidhe It is true that the sources cover Catholic issues, but only the Salvatorian one is actually published by a Catholic institution. I need not go into how varied Catholic newspapers are in their adherence/faithfulness to the Catholic hierarchy and beliefs (see e.g. National Catholic Reporter versus National Catholic Register). But more direclty, there actually are many scholarly RS that discussion Pfeiffer and his works in Nazi-occupied Rome. You will find them on the other language versions of this article. The problem is that I do not read Italian or German well enough to use them in the article. Coverage is not the issue. It is English language coverage. Ergo Sum 13:48, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: perhaps add the word "reportedly" before "saved". I'm inclined to accept in good faith the sources used as reliable – none of them have not been deprecated nor deemed generally unreliable. —Bloom6132 (talk) 16:41, 26 October 2021 (UTC) DYK should not cover unconfirmed reports or rumors so I strongly disagree with that suggestion. As well as assuming sources are reliable if they've never been discussed at WP:RSN, which disregards important parts of WP:RS such as WP:CONTEXTMATTERS. There is no issue with citing sources in Italian or German, but if it's not confirmed that they support the content then it's incorrect to assume that they do. (t · c) buidhe 20:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Bloom6132: I tend to think that statements are either supported by RS and written in wikivoice or they're not accepted at all. For that reason, I shy away from words like "reportedly." I reiterate though that I think it's quite clear there's nothing wrong with the sources currently used. They're all RS, so that should be the end of it. Hence, why I think your initial review was satisfactory. Ergo Sum 23:40, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: agreed. I'm still of the view that the hook satisfies criteria 3b. Criteria 4 states that "Nominations should be rejected if an inspection reveals that they are not based on reliable sources". That is not the case here. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) You're still ignoring the principle in RS that context matters, and some sources are reliable for some but not other info. The two of us who actually write on Holocaust related topics have expressed that the sources cited are not reliable for the exceptional claims being made. (t · c) buidhe 23:59, 26 October 2021 (UTC) With all due respect, I am of the opinion that the sources used are reliable for the info in the hook. The fact that you and Brigade Piron write on Holocaust-related topics is irrelevant – it does not confer a veto over hooks pertaining to that subject. By that logic, I should be able to veto baseball or heraldry hooks ... —Bloom6132 (talk) 01:10, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: Three of my DYKs promoted (including Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands from August this year) have included the word "reportedly" in the hook, as well as numerous hooks from other editors. Disagree all you want – this is accepted practice at DYK. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: I'm aware that you have experience writing about Holocaust-related articles and I put value in your assessment as a solid editor. However, I'm quite comfortable in my ability to vet RS, as well, and my confidence in these sources means I must disagree with your opinion here. Experienced editors do disagree at times, and it is my opinion that I think you have gotten this one wrong; doubtless, you think the same for me. I haven't seen any evidence that these are not RS. Therefore, I recommend if Bloom6132 is inclined to do so, to renew their approval of the hook. In the meantime, I'm going to request the input of additional experienced editors on the DYK talk page. Ergo Sum 01:28, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm going to ping @Bamse, Bermicourt, Jmabel, and Anyfile to see if we can find some reliable sources in other languages. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:46, 27 October 2021 (UTC) Oops, @AnyFile theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:47, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm currently traveling & very busy, so not much help here, I'm afraid. - Jmabel | Talk 01:53, 27 October 2021 (UTC) That said, more or less this same case is made in The Pope's Jews: The Vatican's Secret Plan to Save Jews from the Nazis by Gordon Thomas (not currently cited in the article). - Jmabel | Talk 02:00, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm unclear as to why the cited sources are unreliable: are we assuming that all information emanating from a Roman Catholic source is unreliable? If so what's the logic? In any case there are dozens of book sources in English, German, French and Italian that mention Pfeiffer, the problem is that few are accessible online. One is an entire biography of Pfeiffer "from baker to Vatican diplomat" which would be useful to track down: Willer, Philomena (2005). P. Pankratius Pfeiffer SDS: (1872-1945); vom Bäckergesellen zum Vatikandiplomat. Pub: Josef Fink. Others that mentions Pfeiffer and the Jews in Rome are: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) My issue is with the unreliability of journalistic works and popular history, which have in many cases published inaccurate information about rescues of Jews during the Holocaust. If better sources exist, they should be cited instead. An additional question is, do these sources actually support the claim of "hundreds" of Jews rescued by Pfeiffer personally? (t · c) buidhe 08:51, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I've now found sources that cover most of the article. Here are more: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Prince Constantine of Bavaria (1952) Der Papst. Layer (1985), Schwäbisches Ehrenbuch - Pfeiffer credited with "saving Rome and other Italian cities including Chieti, Ascoli and Ovieto from destruction and other calamities" _ (1999). Publik-Forum - Pfeiffer the only German to have a street named after him in Rome and who fought to save Roman Jews. _ (1960). Bayerische Frömmigkeit - Pfeiffer described as the "Saviour of Rome and other cities in Italy" Robert Katz has written a number of books - Death in Rome (1967), Black Sabbath (1969), The Battle for Rome (2010) - which all mention Pfeiffer. Bottum and Dalin (2004). The Pius War has this interesting piece: "7. Pancrazio [sic] Pfeiffer. According to Carroll-Abbing, one of the men used by Pius XII to protest the Nazi roundup of Rome's Jews and intervene for persecuted victims was Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer, superior general of the Salvatorian Fathers, who also served as Pius XII' personal liaison to the German military command in Rome. Because Pfeiffer died tragically in an automobile accident toward the end of the war and thus never took part in the postwar analysis of Pius XII's conduct, many historians have overlooked him. But those who knew him or have researched his life have chronicled his collaborative efforts with Pius XII to rescue Jews and others during the war. See the article "Pfeiffer's List" by Robert Graham, 30 Days, June 1994, pp. 42-46. Prince Constantine of Bavaria's book on Pius XII, The Pope (London: Allan Wingate, 1954) [listed above] contains an excellent section on Pfeiffer, whom he describes as an agent for the pope on behalf of the victims of persecution and the fugitives in hiding" (p. 213). At Pfeiffer's death in May 1945, Vatican Radio paid tribute: "He came into contact with the Commander of the German occupying forces [in Rome in 1943-44]. From that day onwards, he placed his religious and spiritual qualities at the service of many who had been arrested or already condemned to death. He helped countless people in this way, and saved their lives, among them many Jews and other Italian personages. He championed..." In short there seems to be book evidence for virtually everything stated in the article apart from the specific details of the two incidents where 249 or 400 Jews were rescued. Based on my initial searches my expectation is that those incidents are likely to be recorded in the literature - we just need to be able to access more of the sources. Meanwhile there is no harm in pausing to use some of the above sources, plus those I've added to the Further reading section of the article in order to reinforce the existing references and then review where we are. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: thoughts? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 07:09, 4 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think the article currently meets DYK requirements. For example, Salvatorians USA Province is not independent of the article subject and therefore is not reliable for self-serving assertions such as "he saved many Jews in Rome from persecution and ultimately death" or "Every day, Pfeiffer visited the Regina Coeli prison and another prison on Via Tasso, where he would often return with freed prisoners who had been sentenced to death." (t · c) buidhe 08:27, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: would you still object if the article instead relied on the sources found by Bermicourt? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:58, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Depends, the Samerski source looks reliable to me but the book published by "Österreichische Provinz der Salvatorianer" has the same issue of close connection to the article subject. (t · c) buidhe 06:27, 5 November 2021 (UTC) All right. @Ergo Sum: I'm not going to promote the nomination without consensus to move forward, so if you want to try and rework the article's sourcing to approval, that can work. If you're not, this nomination should probably stop here. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 19:57, 5 November 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: If the issue isn't addressed in a week, I think the best option is to reject this nomination. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 19:29, 10 November 2021 (UTC) Unfortunately, I have had to push this to the back burner.

This slipped my mind completely this weekend. I will deal with this tonight. Ergo Sum 15:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I have added several inline citations to the article, which refer to sources that were (very helpfully) added by Bermicourt. These sources support several of the very specific claims in the article, as well as the general thrust of the article which is in dispute here, namely that Pfeiffer was a liaison and in that capacity saved many Jews and others from the Nazis. In light of these reliable sources supporting the general claims, I think any concern about the pre-existing ones describing some of his more specific actions is ameliorated. There is a trove of additional sources in the Further Reading section that additionally describe in much greater detail Pfeiffer's actions but they are either in a foreign language which I do not adequately read to make use of as citations or are offline. All being said, I think there is now ample sourcing to back up the article's claims. Ergo Sum 05:49, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Ergo Sum—@Buidhe:, if this sourcing is up to your standards, we can move ahead. If not, we're probably going back to WT:DYK and asking for more eyes. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, I've flagged the specific content in the article that supports the hook as needing a better source. There are other active cleanup tags on the article as well. However, I think there's sufficient sourcing for a modified version of the hook without the words "hundreds of". (t · c) buidhe 06:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) We could cite "countless" using the ref above instead of "hundreds of". Bermicourt (talk) 08:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) According to the source it's what Vatican Radio said about him after his death. DYK is not for eulogies imo. (t · c) buidhe 08:37, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not following—is the source unreliable because it's after his death? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) No, it's because it's Catholic presumably... We could always add "according to Vatican Radio..." But better still, we just need to cite the exact text from one of the many non-Catholic book sources and the problem will be solved. Bermicourt (talk) 08:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And yet another source: O'Reilly (2001) in Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation 1943-45 states that "the Vatican was able to assist many of Rome's Jews and others sought by the Germans through Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer's intervention with the Germans... His work was recounted by Robert Graham who has written extensively on the Vatican's role in World War II." Bermicourt (talk) 09:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And another: Bartley (2016) in Catholics Confronting Hitler states that "Father Pancrace [sic] Pfeiffer, a German priest and the superior general of the Salvatorian Order, was the pope's liaison with the German military. Several hundred hostages, including some under sentence of death, owed their release to the efficacious intervention of Father Pfeiffer." I don't know why I'm doing this - you can look up the references yourselves instead of opining and speculating from the sidelines in the classic Wikipedia way. :) Bermicourt (talk) 09:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Bermicourt: Since it seems you have access to several sources that I do not (probably just requires further digging), would you want to add them as inline citations with page numbers, especially to support the proposition regarding hundreds of people saved? Ergo Sum 13:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: I think we're taking that as a 'no'—what's your next step? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:02, 28 November 2021 (UTC) It's not for you to speak for other editors. I'm willing to add one inline citation from those above to support a revised hook, but not to do the nom's job for them. I have other articles to work on. BTW I don't have access to anything more than the internet. Y'all just need to look harder. Bermicourt (talk) 08:21, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Sorry, Bermicourt, I don't mean to give answers on your behalf, but I didn't want the nom to rely on someone else to do the work, like you said, especially if that means stalling the nom for twelve days. also, I appreciate your use of y'all :) theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:49, 29 November 2021 (UTC) :) That and Po' boy is about the extent of my "southern" vocabulary lol.

The phrase "??????????????????????????" means "the only Chinese Internet celebrities who have truly become prominent overseas and successfully cashed in are the top three [in the rankings...] ?? means to monetize (literally: turn into cash), not "successfully realized".

I'd be in favor instead of the hook being split into two separate proposals: one hook about the fact that she was an internet celebrity who grew up in a place without tap water, and a separate hook about her going viral for making hamburgers. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:23, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Full review needed, which can also address the issue of the borderline ALT1 hook. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:23, 5 November 2021 (UTC) As far as I can tell the article meets DYK requirements, and a QPQ has been done. Earwigs finds a close match with Coda Media, but that's only because it was the source for quotes in the article, and all of them are properly referenced. I find the first hook hard to believe given China's international standing, and in any case as brought up by Bowlhover may be inaccurate anyway. As for the second hook, as I mentioned before it's ineligible as it's exactly 200 characters long, and per WP:DYK hooks that are at or shorter than 200 characters may be rejected per reviewer's discretion. Both ALT0 and ALT1 have struck: I am repeating my earlier suggestion that ALT1 instead be split into two separate hooks. As this is a China-related article and there appear to be some political discussion in the article, I'd also like to ask for a second opinion from someone more knowledgeable about China-related articles if the article doesn't fall afoul of relevant guidelines. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:12, 6 November 2021 (UTC) From Wikipedia:Did you know#The hook: The hook should be concise: no more than about 200 characters (including spaces and the question mark, but not including the ..., the space immediately following the ..., or any (pictured)). While 200 is a hard limit, hooks near or at this limit may still be rejected at the discretion of reviewers and administrators. This tool can be used for counting words. The guideline says that "200 is a hard limit", so it is not true that the 200-character ALT1 hook is "ineligible" or "simply too long". No reason has been given for rejecting a 200-character hook "at the discretion of reviewers". Here are two additional hooks based on the suggestion: ALT2: ... that Dianxi Xiaoge, who grew up in a remote Yunnan mountain without running water, is an Internet celebrity with roughly 16 million subscribers on all her platforms? ALT3: ... Dianxi Xiaoge went viral in China and internationally after making hamburgers for her grandparents who had never eaten them before? Cunard (talk) 07:48, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Well for one thing, the original was very difficult to read and seemed to combine too many facts into one hook. Usually DYK prefers simpler hooks whenever possible. In any case, I think ALT3 is the best hook here and the nomination is otherwise good to go, I'd just like to hear a second opinion from another editor on the article tone given that I'm a bit uncomfortable doing a solo review here given the "Commentary" section delves into some political matters. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:36, 7 November 2021 (UTC) On second thought, I have some concerns regarding the length of the article. Isn't it rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:10, 7 November 2021 (UTC) That the article is "rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page" should not be a concern. The sources provided substantial analysis of her and her work, and this article reflects those sources. Other detailed articles for Internet celebrities include PewDiePie and MrBeast. Cunard (talk) 11:18, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Pinging Gatoclass for his input, as he responded to a discussion I raised about this nomination over at WT:DYK. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:57, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think we need Gatoclass to restate themself. Here's what they said at WT:DYK: The article doesn't use the phrase "one of only three Chinese influencers to gain international influence", so I'm not sure where you got that, but it does say she is one of only three "Chinese Internet celebrities who have reached international prominence", and the problem with that claim is that it's sourced to an article that is two years old and therefore not up-to-date. With regard to the overall length, I would agree that it is overly detailed and could use a trim. I'm not sure this is relevant to DYK however, as "overly detailed" is not one of our criteria. What I would say is that the level of detail does raise the chances of close paraphrasing so the article would need to be carefully checked for that. Anybody else with an opinion on this article?

Should "instriptions" (before the Drusus heading) be "inscriptions"? Should the names of scholars be wikilinked, where there is a page for the author (e.g. Simek)?

Self-nominated at 05:52, 28 October 2021 (UTC). Very interesting article and quite the star-studded life—and the worst case of oneitis I've ever heard. Poor Miles. Meets newness and length requirements easily, QPQ done. Earwig brings up the two most-cited sources as potential copyvios. To be expected, since they're cited almost 20 times each, and since the vast majority of the matches concern long quotes I'm willing to overlook it, but can we add more citations throughout the paragraphs? Particularly with "Conflict with Miles and Reynolds", there's four citations crammed at the end of the section. I think we should cite each after the corresponding sentences, especially where there's a direct quotation. Also for ALT0 we need a citation at the ends of the sentences for "Golden Boy" and "Whiz Kid". Otherwise nice read, and good use of sources.

Are we allowed to put :) ? A suggestion: bullet point some of the sentences in the infobox, and add a citation after every sentence....but up to you. Its not completely in the order of medical articles: ie signs & symptoms followed by mechanism followed by diagnosis etc, but I see what you were doing and I see a lot of effort went here. Fulfils DYK. Well done. Thank you. Whispyhistory (talk) 16:34, 12 November 2021 (UTC) :) Apologies...I had another look. The article doesn't say " that 88.5.3.2 may not be an IP address,".... it needs another look @DrVogel:. It also needs to say that in the source. Oversight on my part. Please let me know what you wish to do. Whispyhistory (talk) 04:04, 13 November 2021 (UTC) @Whispyhistory: But that would be impossible, the article can't possibly mention IP addresses, it's about broken toes. The hook is just a hook, and serves its purpose. The example in the hook is actually given in the article, and supported by the sources cited. Dr. Vogel (talk) 06:23, 13 November 2021 (UTC) @DrVogel:, reaching out for advice...@Philafrenzy: or others can we have advice here please... reminds me of the cobblers one. It's okay with me if allowed (dyk says hook needs to be in article and in the following ref). Whispyhistory (talk) 06:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see that exact sequence of numbers in the source, although there are others that look a bit like an IP address. The trouble is, the nominator seems to be the source for it looking a bit like an IP address, which it does, but we can't use that unless the source makes a similar point, which it does not appear to do. Something like this might work (numbers might need to be changed as mentioned): ALT1 ... that a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2? Philafrenzy (talk) 10:16, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Regarding the image, it's a fun idea but I don't think we run images as quizzes and the image is simply a skeletal foot, and not closely enough related to the hook. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:20, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you kindly... will wait for nominator to respond...no hurry. Whispyhistory (talk) 11:29, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, thanks for your input. I don't see how the hook you're suggesting is hooky. What exactly is wrong with the hook proposed? It's in the article and it's supported by the sources cited. And the image is directly related to the hook. It engages the reader into a spotting game. Dr. Vogel (talk) 14:57, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Like everyone else, I rather like the IP-address hook. If we wikilinked IP address, it would be supported in the linked articles, and fulfill the requirement that anyone following the links will be able to verify the hook. I don't think we need sourcing that says that a specific sequence of numbers is an IP address, as we have sources giving the general format of an IP address, and creating an example would be a trivial calculation ("Are all four of these numbers separated by periods in the range 0-255?"): "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com. An IPv4 address has the following format: x . x . x . x where x is called an octet and must be a decimal value between 0 and 255. Octets are separated by periods. An IPv4 address must contain three periods and four octets. The following examples are valid IPv4 addresses: 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 01 . 102 . 103 . 104 This hook is better than any alternative I can think of, and I don't see anything likely to be problematic about it (it's certainly verifiable). I think we might be in agreement on that? So if some rule technically prohibits it, we might have a good case for applying the WP:Ignore all the rules policy. Broken finger is also currently DYK-eligible and I think it uses the same numbering scheme.[1] HLHJ (talk) 02:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edit: add fulltext url] I don't necessarily agree with the reading of WP:DYKCRIT 3b ( Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source [...]) that says that the IP thing needs to be in the article (compare e.g. Template:Did you know nominations/Urine deflector, which similarly took some creative licence in how the proposed hooks were phrased beyond what was stated in either the article or the cited source), and I agree with HLHJ that WP:IAR would be applicable regardless. As for the hooks themselves, writing "a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2" is a much poorer way of writing the hook (less "hooky") than the converse, i.e. "88.5.3.2 may refer to a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone". TompaDompa (talk) 11:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) This. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can't use IP address because the nominator just thought it up "oh, that looks like an IP address". It's not in the source as the nominator admits and therefore is not verifiable. And so what if it does look like an IP address? What does that tell us about broken toes? I like clever or quirky hooks and have written many (if I may say so), but they have to be based on something in the sources otherwise it's things made up one day. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:19, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for all your comments. This is not the place to ignore all rules. The proposed hook is not supported by the source given in the article. I am inclined to approve ALT1 but it needs checking, unless another hook is proposed. Whispyhistory (talk) 15:11, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oh dear, this has become contentious. I think the contended question is whether it's acceptable to have verified information not found in the nominated article, but only in another article, linked in the hook. Not as hooky, but for illustration: ALT3 ... that the dot-decimal notation string "88.5.3.2" is not only an an IPv4 address, but also a fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe? "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com., Hallux proximal phalanx fracture in adults: an overlooked diagnosis I don't think we're debating whether the IP-address-hook statement is verifiable. The statement that "88.5.3.2" (and any number in that format) is a valid IPv4 address is supported by the IP address article and the IPv4 article, and this format is the subject of the Dot-decimal notation article. No-one had bothered to cite those statements in those articles, but since they've been challenged here, I've now cited them. So "88.5.3.2 is both an IP address[1] and a code for a broken toebone[2]" is certainly verifiable, and is now verified on Wikipedia. Any DYK reader should have no trouble verifying that the hook is accurate. Alternatives that do not mention IP addressees are not as hooky, but don't contain more information about broken toes: ALT4 ... that "88.5.3.2" is a toe fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe, while a "78.5.3.2" is the parallel broken finger?

HLHJ (talk) 20:22, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edited to replace the wrong url, copy-paste mistake] Please don't strike the proposed hook as you have done. You certainly don't have consensus to do that. As several people have explained above, the hook is supported by the article and the source. Dr. Vogel (talk) 15:31, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think the reviewer needs consensus Dr Vogel. I agree and have re-struck it. Please work on something else. I am sure you can develop something good, or tweak the Alt1. Philafrenzy (talk) 19:24, 14 November 2021 (UTC) How about ALT2 ... that 88.5.3.2 is one way of describing a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? Philafrenzy (talk) 19:25, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you Philafrenzy ( a very experienced DYK contributor) for your efforts in helping new editors understand DYK. Your comment higher up about "88.5.3.2" and "ip address" not being in the source is true and I am grateful for your suggested alts. Essentially, the initial and subsequent hooks sound good, but none are in the article or the source. I don't wish for personal comments and don't mind if someone else wishes to take over here. With due respect @DrVogel: and @HLHJ:...You may wish to take this up at Wikipedia talk:Did you know. Whispyhistory (talk) 10:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I won't say I wish I hadn't written the article; I hope it's useful enough to make up for the social harm to the project here. I don't think the hostility was intended by anyone; I suspect that it's felt partly due to the ease of mininterpretation in a text-only medium and partly due to human cognitive biases.[2] I certainly did, and do, not intend it. I spent a day's editing trying to resolve the conflict by finding references specifically saying that the two things were in notation X and adding that text to the article, but unfortunately non-inductive descriptions of the notations seem to have been considered so needless that an Internet RFC attempting to formalize them died of disinterest. I did find a source that explicitly defines the IPv4 format, and one that explicitly says that 88.1.2.2 is a specific fracture, and I've cited the latter in the article, but I don't think this helps. It is probably a bit unreasonable to expect a reviewer to do more than apply rules as best they can, and Wikipedia talk:Did you know might indeed be a better forum for a more detailed discussion. I don't really want to take part in one, though (nothing to do with this discussion, prior reasons). I posted because I felt responsible for the conflict and thought I might be able to help. My impression is that I made it worse; my apologies to everyone I've offended. HLHJ (talk) 03:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Nobody is offended, but if I may say so I think you are still missing the point. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity. That's why the sources don't make the comparison and why the IP-based hooks are no good. Any of the other hooks might be fine (I haven't checked the numbers) just without the bit about IP addresses. The whole thing reminds me of unusually shaped vegetables where you may see a carrot shaped like a foot, people who see faces in clouds, and even apophenia. My personal observation that one thing looks a bit like another is not the basis for a hook unless reliable sources make the point too. Philafrenzy (talk) 09:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Folks, we are wasting a wonderful hook. Really. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity and that is the whole point of making good hooks. They are supposed to be short, punchy, catchy, and likely to draw the readers in to wanting to read the article – as long as they don't misstate the article content. And one of the best recipes to make a hook good is to make it sound counterintuitive With any other option but the original, we are bound to receive another hook frequented by maybe a few hundred visitors. I would propose something to the tune of in some contexts, 88.5.3.2 might not mean an IP address but a broken bone in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? so that no one claims here that we somehow delegitimise the IP address but at the same time so that we preserve the core of the hook. As for the claims that because the hook is not cited in the IP part, it can't be there - please don't be that pedantic. In our today's world of informatics we may assume that people who visit Wikipedia more or less imagine what IP addresses are, and may more or less imagine how they look like (in the worst case they will visit the article for details). The other part is cited. I see no problem with the original. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Szmenderowiecki I admit that I'm not very familiar with the topic, and the above discussion was confusing, but is the "this isn't an IP address" claim actually in the source? Because if it's not, then no matter how good the hook proposal is, it can't be used in a hook since hook facts need to be based on a reference. Also, I'm pretty sure that assumptions don't count as sources. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:31, 17 November 2021 (UTC) What I was leading is that we don't need to cite that the sky is blue, or that we have five fingers; or that there exist IP addresses for that matter. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 11:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Given that these IP number hooks aren't working out so far, I wonder if some other hooks unrelated to that could be proposed here. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 02:11, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment only If we accept the first hook we will end up with thousands of hits, some quiet smiles and some who will continue to believe that DYK broke the rules. We're allowed to. This is not a massive occasion where we can save the whole project by breaking the rules. Its a trivial example of what some (not all) think may be a breach in the rules, with a small, but amusing, advantage. So I'm not asking the defenders of the rules to admit that this is not a breech ... I am suggesting that they might just concede that the harm done by allowing this hook might not offend anyone ... and it might please a few thousand. Victuallers (talk) 15:28, 20 November 2021 (UTC) We don't need to break the rules. The observation that the notation looks a bit like an IP address is trivial and completely unrelated to broken toes. There are already perfectly good hooks above that work better. Nobody is saying don't use the numbers, just strike the bit about IP addresses. The originally proposed hook is not the work of comic genius and cleverness that some seem to think it is. Philafrenzy (talk) 21:58, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The main issue here is that it's one of the core rules of DYK that hook facts must be mentioned in the article, ideally explicitly or at least implied by supporting information. The thing is that at the moment, IP addresses are not mentioned anywhere in the article, so the hooks using the IP address angle would be ineligible according to that criterion anyway. Even April Fools hooks, which tend to be misleading, are still generally based on hook facts that are mentioned in the respective articles. So if we can't even grant IAR exemptions for that criterion for AFD hooks, the one day of the year where our hooks tend to follow the rules most loosely, I can't see why such a request should be granted here. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:20, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @DrVogel: In the absence of consensus in favor of using the number angle, can hooks based on other facts be proposed here?

Nominated by Victuallers (talk) at 16:21, 6 November 2021 (UTC). Article is new enough. Two correct writers are credited. The article is fully referenced. No copyvio detected. There is a bit of biased POV pushing in Wikipedia voice: "most vulnerable to climate change". This will be something our subject is saying no doubt. And this idea is also reflected in the hook with "endangered". The hook content is referenced and confirmed by the Guardian, apart from the "endangered" bit, which opinion is attributed to Tina Stege. So I suggest that "endangered" is taken out of the hook, or it is reworded so it is clear she is saying that. Hook alt1 is unsuitable as it does not link the article and I cannot tell what it is trying to say in relation to the subject. I can confirm image is CC-BY-3.0 as derived from the video with CC-BY-3.0 license. However I would suggest that a different image is selected from the video, perhaps near the end where the microphone is not obscuring her chin. QPQ is done. Graeme Bartlett (talk) 06:03, 15 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Thanks for the review Graeme - I have recut a new image. Surprised that "endangered" wasn't referenced.

Graeme Bartlett (talk) 20:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Are you suggesting that we imply that "endangered" is her opinion despite the fact that she represents a nation and the "endangered" aspect is supported by the World Bank and the Guardian newspaper (and the 1bn people estimated to be part of the "High Ambition" group ) saying so? Is there any evidence that is just her opinion and not that of her country and the World Bank? Am I missing something? It you feel you need to give this "a cross" then can I suggest that we ask for a new reviewer?I have suggested an alt that does not use the endangered word.

Self-nominated at 23:51, 4 November 2021 (UTC). @DferDaisy: This article is about 3300 bytes, and was nominated for DYK shortly after creation, satisfying date and length criteria. There is a factual error, as the article states she was interred in Keokuk, Illinois, but the source says she died in Chicago, Illinois and was interred in Keokuk, Iowa. I am assuming good faith for a few references I cannot access (for example, ref 15 - The National Humane Review), which for me gives a landing page for the document, instead of an inside view). Otherwise, everything is properly sourced and there are no copyvio or close paraphrasing concerns (Earwig cites 3 potential problems, but they are not an issue here.) QPQ not required. Regarding the hooks, ALT0 is incorrect as stated, as it reads as if the study was conducted in the early 1900s by Meigs Crowder, whereas she published it in 1917 based on studies from that period. It'll need minor alteration. ALT1 is fine and sourced. I would prefer to promote an amended ALT0. A minor quibble, though not an issue for DYK: please add page numbers for cited sources.

At the time the lawsuit was filed, this was not the case, and in fact the trial judge ruled against Alouche (see last paragraph of background section); it was only after the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the "common employer doctrine" was established, and it became entrenched when leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. Mindmatrix 15:11, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, so the idea behind the hook is that, since Downtown Eatery changed the law on common employers, before Downtown Eatery Best Beaver would not have been Alouche's employer? That makes more sense. AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 15:20, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: I'm going to inspect this again... Mindmatrix 15:18, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Alright, so to ensure everything is correct, the following timeline occurred: Alouche was hired to be manager at For Your Eyes Only (owned by Grad and Grosman), and began work on 29 December 1992 Alouche was sent a Notice of Discipline in May 1993, and was fired on 15 June 1993 In October 1993, Alouche filed action for wrongful dismissal against Best Beaver Management Inc., as that was the source of his paycheques Best Beaver ceased operations in mid-1996, and all assets distributed to other companies owned by Grad and Grosman The trial resolved in favour of Alouche Best Beaver did not pay out the judgement (all its assets had been redistributed) Sherriffs were dispatched to For Your Eyes Only, where they seized $1,855 Downtown Eatery filed claim against Alouche, stating the cash belonged to it Alouche defended, and counterclaimed against Grad, Grosman, and all companies they controlled on the grounds of common employer doctrine, the oppression remedy of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, and fraudulent conveyance the judge in the second trial (at Ontario Superior Court of Justice) ruled against Alouche the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the previous ruling was overturned in 2001 in January 2002, an application for leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed So, the common employer doctrine was part of the second trial as a counterclaim to the suit filed by Downtown Eatery. I just wanted to ensure this satisfies your concerns. Mindmatrix 18:25, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for this incredibly thorough response. My concern is maybe philosophical or definitional. If I say that company A employs person B, that has an ordinary meaning and a legal meaning. It is probably right that Best Beaver did not employ Alouche in the ordinary sense of "employ", because Best Beaver was a "paymaster" and not the name on the front of the building where he went to work. My reading of the case itself is that, before Downtown Eatery, it was at best indeterminate as a legal matter whether Best Beaver, alone or in combination with its affiliate companies, employed Alouche. After Downtown Eatery, it was established—as a matter of legal meaning, but not necessarily ordinary meaning—that Best Beaver was his employer, or part of his employer, or something like that. The reason I brought this up is that it's not clear how one could verify the claim that "Best Beaver was not Alouche's employer", because that claim might be true as a matter of ordinary meaning but the only authoritative legal ruling we have on this (namely, Downtown Eatery) holds that the claim is false. In any event, I'll leave this to the eventual reviewer to sort out. I find my brain twisting into knots. AleatoryPonderings (???)

Interesting: N - see below Other problems: N - see below QPQ: None required. Overall: Hello, Mungo and welcome to DYK! Review as follows: The article is new enough, long enough and neutral. However, it includes a WP:IMDB source and I am unsure about the reliability of several other sources, including Film Ink, Queer Media Matters, Antaeus.org, Fern TV, Addicted to Horror Movies, Dan's Papers, Go Mag, Three Women in a Box and North Coast Rep. To add to that, the YouTube link does not appear to be uploaded by an official channel, making it unreliable. Additionally, per MOS:FILMCAST uncredited roles need a source. the copyvio checker showed up a 50%+ similarity with a source, which may suggest over quotation. On top of that, the subject has unclear notability. I'm unsure which roles are significant and The House on Pine Street appears to have a questionable notability. None of her awards seem significant and I'm not seeing any significant coverage from reliable, independent sources. ALT0 isn't very interesting given the festival is not significant enough to have an article. I think ALT1 is interesting but it seems to focus more on the character, not the actress which isn't exactly ideal... QPQ not needed. We'll need some work but we'll get there!

If you look at my editing history, I've had ten straight days where I did not edit, one big reason being that I have family-related matters that needed attending to, such as Thanksgiving and another more somber matter.

Source: 1 and 2 Comment: This is the first time I’ve ever made a DYK here, so here goes. I personally find this fact interesting because it highlights how the advent of YouTube, and internet fame in general, has allowed people to use their voice to reach people in positions of high influence, bringing hidden ideas to light and advocating for change. While this specific example falls under a video game/pop-culture category, and may not fit Wikipedia’s desire for academic material, I feel that this is interesting enough to share, as it’s one the gaming community can relate to, like with other social media trends such as #FreeSmash and "Rerelease Mother 3." As for the article itself, all of the citations should be reliable enough; they’re all from third-party/secondary source outlets and there isn’t any BLP violation to be found here. One concern I have is criteria #3 - “Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source, appearing no later than the end of the sentence(s) offering that fact. Citations at the end of the paragraph are not sufficient.” While the hook is sourced in the article, the refs are at the end of the section rather than per each sentence. I can fix that however. Anyway, I hope this fact does get accepted! If not, I understand, thanks for reviewing this anyway. Created/expanded by PantheonRadiance (talk). Self-nominated at 08:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

Source: [10] Reviewed: Central Asian Orogenic Belt 5x expanded by Mccunicano (talk). Self-nominated at 00:06, 16 November 2021 (UTC). Newness requirement satisfied by 5x expansion on 11/15 from < 600 to > 3000 characters. Articles also long enough and compliant with core policies on citations and neutrality. The hook is in-line sourced. Photo has appropriate license. QPQ is done. There are, however, two problems: (1) There is some significant overlap with this source. To start, the following sentence is taken from the source without use of quotation marks and with no effort to paraphrase rather than use the precise words: "Local advocacy led to the establishment of Bridle Trails as a state park in 1932." Further, this sentence also strikes me as too closely drawn from the same source: "Initial park development dates to 1933 when Civil Works Administration employees and federal relief workers were employed in state parks as part of the New Deal program. Further work included burning logging debris, clearing brush and building trails and fences." Work needs to be done to put the material into your own words. (2) The hook strikes me as boring in that it states an obvious point. Horses having the right of way on this trail is not unique or special. On trails that are shared by humans and horses, it is the general rule that horses have the right of way. See here ("In general, horses always have the right of way, followed by hikers, then by bikers."). See also here ("For safety reasons, if you come across a horse and rider on any trail they always have right of way. Hikers and bike riders all yield to horses.") To include this on the main page, we really need something that is hooky or interesting about this trail.

For one, the quote is not actually "could have been made by aliens" so, considering this is all about misquotation, we should either use the actual quote or clarify that it is a misquotation. Then "as though it was a real announcement" implies that it was actually, I don't know, a fake announcement? A parody?

I've been trying to come up with something catchy on this -- for example, had Comeau invited Trump to participate in a performance of the work, then we could say he told Trump to fugue himself -- but the sourcing just isn't there that I can see.

I therefore want to use this platform to suggest ways we can contribute to meaningful anti-Trump resistance.". We'd need to flesh out the article with these WP:BLPPRIMARY sources for the "thinks" to be properly verifiable.

There is over-linking in the hook. Copyvio seems fine (ignoring the 90% violation, which is a website which copies Wikipedia) QPQ not required. But, the 'Background' section is entirely copied from 2021 United States Electoral College vote count. (1) It is done without attribution, see Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia (2) Per WP:DYKCRIT 1b, copied content does not count while calculating characters. So, the actual character count is 2,438 characters (verified by manually copy-pasting). The entire 'Background' section is uncited, and most of the 'Joint Session of Congress' section is also uncited. There are few prose issues, which would not be difficult to fix, but the sourcing issues is a major issues, certainly enough to prevent this from being approved. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 17:13, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Capisred, Kavyansh.Singh, while material copied from a public domain source can simply be excluded from the prose character count, material copied from other Wikipedia articles falls under a different and more restrictive rule (WP:DYKSG#A5): If some of the text in a nominated article was copied from another Wikipedia article, and the copied text is more than seven days old, then the copied text must be expanded fivefold as if the copied text had been a separate article. In this case, the Background section, which was copied from an existing article within Wikipedia more than seven days after the section was originally written, had 3,422 prose characters, so while that copied text can be counted, the article as a whole would need to be expanded to 17,100 prose characters, which is prohibitive, even excluding the templated sourcing issues.

Moved to mainspace by Artem.G (talk). Nominated by Ornithoptera (talk) at 07:36, 26 November 2021 (UTC). @Ornithoptera: My apologies for the length of this review. Nominated for DYK five days after being moved to main namespace, and is over 8400, easily satisfying length and date criteria. I will assume good faith for the refs I cannot access (ref 5 - World Catalogue of Odonata; and ref 12 - The dragonflies (Odonata) of Singapore). In the distribution section, the first paragraph mentions T. plagiata is found in Thailand, and the end of the second paragraph states it "has been additionally recorded in Thailand", which seems redundant. The same can be said for the closing sentences of the "life history" and "habitat" sections. In the last paragraph in "Threats and conservation", "He additionally stated..." does not refer to the previously mentioned Y. Norma-Rashid, but D.H. Murphy, who was mentioned even earlier in the paragraph, so this needs tweaking to ensure the statement is properly attributed. The text states "...which were adapted for grasping prey...", but the source does not mention prey (it could be adapted for grasping a perch, for example). Although there's no copyvio per se, there does appear to be some similarity between text and source, such as these two examples: [Article]: "...prementum was robust and had distal expansion with thin and hook like labial palps, serrated along the inner margins" [Source]: "...prementum robust and expanded distally with labial palps thin and hook-like, serrate along their inner margins" [Article]: "The stream itself was filled with organic matter such as leaf litter and fallen branches. [Source]: "The stream was filled with debris such as leaf litter and fallen branches." I realize that with such terse source, there can be some overlap of this sort, but there are quite a few instances in this article. Please use page numbers for citations, for example with {{rp}}. Searching for details in refs, particularly the longer ones, is quite cumbersome without having some way to narrow the range of text to search. I spent far too much time doing this. You can also remove citations from the intro, as all that text summarizes the remaining article, all of which already has the necessary citations. The image is an illustration of the subject that is suitable and clear at the size required for DYK. It has been freely licenced by the uploader. My only concern is that this is that user's only contribution to Commons, which piques my curiosity. Tineye reports no online copies of this image. The hooks are fine and sourced, though I'm curious if they should be qualified with 'females'; the article doesn't seem to mention if the males also exceed the size of other species. QPQ completed. Mindmatrix 02:25, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Hello @Mindmatrix:! Don't worry about the length of the review itself, all it shows me is that you put your time and care into it and that really does matter to me! I'll try to address your concerns in the review in itself, and if there continues to be issues please do inform me. I'll use your review as a guide for my editing. I have never used page numbers in my citations, and this is a fairly new thing for me to have come across, so I'll try and be vigilant next time. Forgive me though, just new to all of this, I haven't encountered it enough within my history editing Wikipedia articles. Regarding the image though, the illustration was made by one of my friends who offered to draw it for the article. Since they had no Wikipedia account, I requested that they make one, since I was uncertain of how to go about properly crediting them if I were to upload the image myself. Its a bit of a strange predicament, but I hope you understand! I'll try and address your concerns in the next few edits hopefully tonight so it can be up to snuff! Ornithoptera (talk) 03:33, 29 November 2021 (UTC) I can confirm Ornithoptera's statement that I created an account to add the image I created to the article. Ornithoptera being my friend, suggested that I provide art for Wikipedia articles with this article being the first. We found this the easiest way to add my art without having to worry about crediting me. Splendidsponges (talk) 09:41, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Hey @Mindmatrix:, I did several of the suggested edits, however I am a bit uncertain about how to go forward with some of the suggestions and thus I am writing to get a clear idea of areas to address and to alleviate some of my confusions on what to do. The first example I really am struggling to word it in a way that would not be similar to the source, I am not familiar enough with larval Anisopteran anatomy and the related terminology to accurately provide an alternative description that would be both relevant and accurate. I am also uncertain due to the fact that the issue seems to be present within the article but rewording those two examples would probably not be enough to get it through, since I myself did not deliberately put those similarities in, and thus I'm not sure which areas would be of concern, so further clarity would be helpful? Another question I had was regarding if the suggestion for page numbers was for the future or to be implemented within the article for the issue to be properly addressed, with such a lengthy article it would be a bit of work for someone who has never properly utilized the feature before. I also wanted to state that I'm unsure why the aspect of adults' habitat is considered a redundancy, as motile adults can venture outside of their aquatic habitats and thus inhabit different areas. Regardless, I do appreciate the in-depth feedback, its a bit overwhelming in all honesty, but if there is a roadmap on what I should do next I would dearly appreciate that. A roadmap would mostly be helpful because there is a lot of concerns within the article that I don't exactly know how to tackle personally bit by bit, and knowing for sure what I need to do before it can be approved for DYK is a good idea. I understand that it is not your job but anything would be helpful because there is a lot to be addressed here, and hopefully it can be. Thank you so much for all your time and effort put into this!

I'm quite confident a more expanded article would be a more attractive thing to present to the reader (and there would be plenty of more interesting hooks. Did you know that a recently discovered 1692 libretto of an actual Abendmusik bears similarities to Wacht! Euch zum Streit?[1][2]. Or that the Abendmusiken were actually presented right after Vespers?[3] Vespers, which themselves lasted two or three hours, in addition to a further three or four hour Hauptgottesdienst in the morning?[4][5] That might be one of the reasons why the audience was reported to be so disorderly, to the point that the town watch had to be hired to maintain a semblance of order.[6] That, and a lot more, which would surely allow to take this to DYK at a later time, after having greatly expanded this. Or at least, it's my opinion that taking the sole opportunity for DYK now would be a waste when it can be done when the article is expanded and made into something significantly more attractive and informative.

Fact is, I have the score and the whole text (including in translation) with me, in addition to lots of critical commentary on the piece itself (too much of which is focused on the question of authenticity, but alas...) and on the Abendmusiken in general. This can be used to make a proper article, but it would require time, which at the moment I really need to put into meeting an actual deadline than here. I've given you a list of pertinent sources (many of which are in German, if that's easier for you), if you're interested you know where to ask. On top of all of that, there's the question of article title (should it be at the current one or at Wacht! Euch zum Streit gefasset macht (a title which is used in a fair amount of sources, too...)

Barton, Kinder and Alderson ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that the only stained glass exported to the United States by Barton, Kinder and Alderson was assessed an import duty because it was priced too low to be classified as artwork? Source: Ref 6 "These windows were custom-made and are the only known examples of the firm’s work in this country" for the first part of the hook; Ref 9, the US Senate Judiciary Committee report, too long to summarize here, but the import duty part is based on that source. Reviewed: Template:Did you know nominations/Majestic Theatre (Broadway) Created by MB (talk). Self-nominated at 04:09, 27 November 2021 (UTC). New enough, long enough, and adequately sourced. (A duplicate footnote could be re-used rather than repeated, but that's not an issue for DYK.) QPQ done. Earwig found no copying. However, "too low to be classified as artwork" from the hook is not clearly stated in the article. Instead, the article states that the tariff was waived for things that had a combination of three requirements: (1) high value, (2) artwork, (3) destined for a church. It goes on to state that because of not meeting requirement (1), the tariff was not waived. It does not state that failing (1) was assumed to imply also failing (2). So either we need a clear statement that the low value made it a non-artwork, from a source that clearly supports that implication, or we need a better hook. —David Eppstein (talk) 19:19, 27 November 2021 (UTC) The article says "imported stained glass considered artwork for use in churches, and valued at over $15/sq ft, was duty-free under the Tariff Act of 1930". The source says "stained or painted window glass (or entire windows) which are works of art, when imported to be used in a house of worship valued at $15 or more per square foot, are free of customs duties..." I think the article accurately paraphrases the source. I don't agree with your parsing of this into three requirements. What is artwork is highly subjective and therefore a government tariff cannot possibly be written with such vague language. It gives two objective criterion - (1) destined for a church and (2) high value (which makes it artwork, otherwise it would be construction materials). When the source discusses why a tariff was assessed, it expresses it in terms of which objective criterion it did not meet (value). The hook merely states it from the perspective of not being artwork. The hook would be quite boring if it said "because it was priced under $15/sq ft. I don't see a problem here. MB 04:33, 28 November 2021 (UTC) I do not see a problem with the article. The problem is with the hook. The article says "considered artwork", "for use in churches", AND over $15. Your quotation of the source indicates that the article is accurate. Your hook suggests that the artistic value of a work is measured by its price, and that cheap works cannot be artistic. I don't see this implication anywhere in the source or in the article. Both of them suggest instead to me that, although it may be possible for cheap works to be artistic, they cannot have their tariff waived because they are cheap. Similarly, I think it would be reasonable to understand the source as meaning that if a church imports an expensive chunk of stained glass that has not been crafted into stained glass art (maybe for instance bulk glass sheets of some expensive type), then even though it is expensive it could not have the tariff waived because it is not art. As for your final comment, "The hook would be quite boring if": interestingness is important, but not a valid rationale for incorrectness. —David Eppstein (talk) 07:53, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Bilingirl ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that Bilingirl ran a nail salon before she started posting on YouTube?

Source: first quote from dewitt in info world, second from moriarty in analog Created by Maury Markowitz (talk). Self-nominated at 15:12, 25 November 2021 (UTC). "The original Atari 810 was noisy, slow and inefficient by today's standards". The reference is a magazine article from 1982 introducing a newer product, so of course it tries to make the older product sound bad in comparison. The early 80s was a time when progress was rapid and a couple of years would show enormous advances. Back in the day, the 810 was about the same order of reliability as the drives for the Apple II and the C64 - all of which were bad by the standards of the mid 1980's, let alone the standards of the 21st century. The 810 had about the same read speed as the drives on other platforms. However, it was notorious for being roughly twice as slow on writes. This was for the very good reason that every write was followed by a read to verify that the data was written correctly. Other platforms typically did a write without a verification read and were therefore twice as fast but also tended to have more disk errors. 810 drives had a lot less disk errors than the other platforms. There was also an option to turn off the verification read, making it just as fast (and also just as error prone) as the rest. The 810 had a good reputation throughout the 1980s and had aftermarket kits to increase its throughput and to increase its capacity to true double density using the same physical mechanism.
