ti :: 2242825-0001 NuBus Spec1983 : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive Skip to main content Can You Chip In? The Internet Archive is growing faster than ever before, and we need your help. As an independent nonprofit, we build and maintain all our own systems, but we don’t charge for access, sell user information, or run ads—instead we're powered by donations averaging $30. Unfortunately, fewer than 1 in 1000 of our patrons donate. We don't ask often, but right now, we have a 2-to-1 Matching Gift Campaign, tripling the impact of every donation. If each of our users gave just $3, we could end this fundraiser today—so if you find all these bits and bytes useful, please pitch in. —Brewster Kahle, Founder, Internet Archive Continue Maybe later Send me an email reminder Email address (required) Please enter a valid email address.
