Wikipedia:In the news/Candidates - Wikipedia Wikipedia:In the news/Candidates From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia < Wikipedia:In the news Jump to navigation Jump to search Page for suggesting items for "In the news" Welcome to In the news. Please read the guidelines. Admin instructions are here. ??Skip to suggestions In the news toolbox Error reports Nominations (Archives) Discussion General criteria Death criteria Recurring items Admin guide Image protection Current events portal v t e Shortcut WP:ITN/C This page provides a forum for editors to suggest items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page, as well as the forum for discussion of candidates. This is not the page to report errors in the ITN section on the Main Page—please go to the appropriate section at WP:ERRORS. Archives of past nominations can be found here. This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. Under each daily section header below is the transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day (with a light green header). Each day's portal page is followed by a subsection for suggestions and discussion. A blurb is a one sentence summary of the news story. An alternate suggestion for the blurb is called an altblurb, and any more suggestions get labelled alt1, alt2, etc. A blurb needs at least one target article, highlighted in bold; reviewers check the quality of that article and whether it is updated, and whether reliable sources demonstrate the significance of the event. Other articles can also be linked. The Ongoing line is for regularly updated articles which cover events that remain in the news over a longer period of time. RD stands for the "recent deaths" line, and can include any living thing whose death was recently announced. In some cases, recent deaths may need additional explanation as provided by a blurb; this is decided by consensus.

Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates. These are automatically generated (at midnight UTC) by a bot; creating them manually breaks this process. Nominate the blurb for ITN inclusion under the "Suggestions" subheading for the date, emboldening the link in the blurb to the updated article. Use a level 4 header (====) when doing so. Preferably use the template {{ITN candidate}} to nominate the article related to the event in the news. Make sure that you include a reference from a verifiable, reliable secondary source. Press releases are not acceptable. The suggested blurb should be written in simple present tense. Adding an explanation why the event should be posted greatly increases the odds of posting. Please consider alerting editors to the nomination by adding the template {{ITN note}} to the corresponding article's talk page. Purge this page to update the cache There are criteria which guide the decision on whether or not to put a particular item on In the news, based largely on the extensiveness of the updated content and the perceived significance of the recent developments. These are listed at WP:ITN. Submissions that do not follow the guidelines at Wikipedia:In the news will not be placed onto the live template. Headers[edit] Items that have been posted or pulled from the main page are generally marked with (Posted) or (Pulled) in the item's subject so it is clear they are no longer active. Items can also be marked as (Ready) when the article is both updated and there seems to be a consensus to post. The posting admin, however, should always judge the update and the consensus to post themselves. If you find an entry that you don't feel is ready to post is marked (Ready), you should remove the mark in the header. Voicing an opinion on an item[edit] Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated. Please do not...[edit] add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are usually not helpful. Instead, explain the reasons why you think the item meets or does not meet the ITN inclusion criteria so a consensus can be reached. oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism). Conflicts of interest are not handled at ITN. comment on a story without first reading the relevant article(s). oppose a recurring item here because you disagree with the recurring items criteria. The criteria can be discussed at the relevant talk page.

I also assume that the exact date of birth and death can be determined after some searching, because there are bound to be some obituaries.KittenKlub (talk) 09:47, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle An important figure in Motown.

As an "important figure in Motown", there should be more materials to include in this wikibio. Please expand the article. The {Lead too short} tag also needs to be addressed before this RD nom can proceed. --PFHLai (talk) 21:33, 28 November 2021 (UTC) (Closed) Ukrainian coup d'état plot[edit] WP:SNOW. No chance.

Sucessful coup definitely. Troops or whatever actually made the move but was beaten back by loyal security forces probably. Arrested before anything happened not so much. -- KTC (talk) 00:27, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose I don't think it was thwarted as much as exposed. Basically, Zelensky alleged that there will be a coup on December 1 involving the opposition.

Once we get it there, perhaps we can look at blurb. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:46, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Support blurb in principle This guy is widely considered the greatest musical theatre composer of all time. However, as noted above, the article is not yet ready. NorthernFalcon (talk) 22:50, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Support blurb in principle, since the article's own lede kind of gives him that (provided it's sourced properly, of course). rawmustard (talk) 22:56, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: Perhaps someone should first propose a blurb and post it here on WP:ITN/C before any more people vote "support" for a blurb? Perhaps we need separate voting on article quality and readiness? --PFHLai (talk) 23:16, 26 November 2021 (UTC) To your first point, no. Everyone knows the formula for an RD blurb, whether they see it or not (national job description Someone Surname (pictured) dies at the age of x). That second idea is intriguing. InedibleHulk (talk) 06:51, 27 November 2021 (UTC) I don't understand how one can decide to support a blurb, or not support it, without knowing the vocabulary used for "national job description". I think Sunshineisles2's blurb got it right, though. --PFHLai (talk) 16:01, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: Proposed blurb, and I would additionally support blurb in principle when the article can be sufficiently improved. Few figures from the theatre world would qualify more than Sondheim as a transformative name in the field: the article leads on quoting the Medal of Freedom ceremony crediting him with "[reinventing] the American musical," there are theaters on both Broadway and the West End named after him, and there was literally a quarterly journal solely dedicated to his work that ran for over two decades.--Sunshineisles2 (talk) 23:20, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality until that's fixed, it's a moot point, as it can't go onto RD or ITN blurb unless it's sufficient quality. Joseph2302 (talk) 00:57, 27 November 2021 (UTC) No Blurb Big name in a big field, which will draw attention to itself in RD (pending article fixup). Nothing at all newsworthy about his age. Photo RD as an honorary gesture, if that's the goal. InedibleHulk (talk) 04:13, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Have we ever done a "photo RD"? Mlb96 (talk) 09:08, 27 November 2021 (UTC) No Once or twice, but that attitude didn't stop Stephen Sondheim from trying new nice things, c'mon! InedibleHulk (talk) 09:35, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Very occasionally: it's admittedly not a regular occurrence by any stretch. This is the most recent time I can think of, and it's been nearly two years. Though I wouldn't oppose a photo RD every once in a while.--Sunshineisles2 (talk) 14:36, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Mlb96 I tried it once - I was reverted and told I was crazy. I gave up at that point. Black Kite (talk) 11:40, 28 November 2021 (UTC) "Not going left, not going right"? Martinevans123 (talk) 11:48, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose blurb Of the theatre/film composers, Sondheim, Morricone and Williams are definitely at the top of the field and all deserve a blurb. However, considering that Morricone was dismissed for a blurb as an "old man", it'd be unjust to bypass it and give Sondheim a blurb (the same would be the case for Williams).--Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 07:45, 27 November 2021 (UTC) To be clear, the only reason I didn't say "old man dies" for this one was because I said OMD in the summary. Nothing personal. They were equally old and expressive in my books (and all subjectively beneath Carpenter, Elfman and Johnston). InedibleHulk (talk) 08:20, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Support blurb in principle A giant in the theatre world. Created so many masterworks, influenced so much culture. The top of his field. Passes the "Thatcher/Mandela" standard we sometimes use regarding world leader RDs. Transformational global leader. -TenorTwelve (talk) 07:52, 27 November 2021 (UTC) I agree. Although, in fact, only 5' 8"? Martinevans123 (talk) 10:47, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – (My 2¢) – I would oppose a blurb via the old-man-dies theme, but I don't know enough about his field to gauge 'transformativity.' Must admit he probably qualifies as a household name among the culturally aware – which, alas, may be a minority. – Sca (talk) 14:31, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Support blurb because of his prolific career at the top of his field. Him dying naturally as a nonagenarian doesn't disqualify him. Jim Michael (talk) 15:19, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Support either blurb or Photo RD in principle: ("in principle" because I leave others to judge quality). Sunshineisles2 has pointed out above that we posted this Photo RD 2 years ago. Basically something to mark the passing of a very notable individual, so either a blurb or a Photo RD.Tlhslobus (talk) 20:01, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Neutral, but why is his name not in the RD namelist already? -DePiep (talk) 20:57, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Some paras still without sources. Send in the cn tags? Martinevans123 (talk) 21:05, 27 November 2021 (UTC) How many "SUPPORT RD" votes so far? "in principle" does not count. --PFHLai (talk) 21:19, 27 November 2021 (UTC) No not the blurb. Just his name in the RD list. -DePiep (talk) 21:36, 27 November 2021 (UTC) As with Colin Powell: d. 18 Oct, only 20 Oct name in RD. -DePiep (talk) 21:43, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Because there are multiple paragraphs that lack a single reference. Stephen 22:04, 27 November 2021 (UTC) The WP:ITN/C § intro says: "A blurb needs ... target article ... check the quality of that article ... updated, ... reliable sources demonstrate the significance...": about quality for blurb article then. Then it says: "RD line ... can include any living thing whose death was recently announced". iow: no restriction by article quality for RD inclusion. Personally I find it reasonable that an article that was obviously BLP-conformant and that has an RS death announdement, can be linked to from RD. Anyway, an omittance, just as with Colin Powell (who was added to RD without blurp-quality articele— 2 days later b/c of similar blurb discussion). -DePiep (talk) 05:14, 28 November 2021 (UTC) We don’t post sub-standard biographies as a blurb or to recent deaths. Stephen 05:24, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Is what I am questioning. So far, only the blurb is explicitly mentioned for such a requirement. Also, I cannot find the reasoning that forces us to have such an omission on MP. -DePiep (talk) 05:32, 28 November 2021 (UTC) For any section on the Main Page (which includes ITN), any featured article is expected to demonstrate the quality with which WP editors can write. We don't expect FA quality for ITN featured items, but an article on an RD better be up to BLP specifications as a minimum standard, and that means large swathes of text missing sourcing is not a demonstration of our best work. --Masem (t) 05:37, 28 November 2021 (UTC) WP:ITNRD point 4 says "Of sufficient quality to be posted on the main page, as determined by a consensus of commenters." The linked section on article quality says, in part, "Articles should be well referenced; one or two "citation needed" tags may not hold up an article, but any contentious statements must have a source, and having entire sections without any sources is unacceptable." Thryduulf (talk) 14:44, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Support blurb One of the most notable living people in the theater world before his death. Blurb is warranted. Thriley (talk) 06:41, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Support blurb, top of the field. --Clibenfoart (talk) 09:16, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Note: Citations now improved. Any more required, or can this be posted? Martinevans123 (talk) 14:16, 28 November 2021 (UTC) There are still at least eight paragraphs without a single reference, and many more with content that isn’t sourced by refs present. So, not by a long shot. Kingsif (talk) 21:27, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Would you care to add appropriate cn tags, or even add a reference or two? Or perhaps you could improve "the tone"? Thanks so much. Martinevans123 (talk) 22:27, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Support blurb now. I respect the application of WP:BLPRS to this project. However, it's counterintuitive to demand further refinement of a very long, good article with 200 citations while posting other articles so short they barely pass AFD.

This new information is very important due to the mutations in the variant TapticInfo (talk) 20:06, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose we have COVID in ongoing. We have no real data other than how mutated this variant is. If it is the "end of days" variant, I'd support a blurb, but in the meantime, ongoing covers it well. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 20:21, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. I concur with TRM. I think every variant is concerning, but there isn't yet anything unusual about this one. 331dot (talk) 20:26, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Ok, a momentary pause: it is unusual in that the UK (for example) has already banned flights from southern Africa. No-one could land from there in the UK from midday today (and I know someone now stranded in Botswana as a result). So that is highly unusual. But it's purely precautionary based on what the UK didn't do with the delta variant. So there's a spectrum of "usualness". The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 20:29, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Support This is the first VOC since Delta (and we all know how that one turned out). Covid is on ongoing but this is I think a big enough update. Nixinova ??T ? C 20:57, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Wait The WHO said that it will take a few weeks to assess the impact. Until its impact becomes clear, it should stay off the front page. NW1223(Howl at me/My hunts) 20:53, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Comment. I wonder if the EU, US, UK and Canada imposing new travel bans on various African nations as a result of the new variant is noteworthy enough for the front page. Calidum 21:03, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Support. It took the WHO all of two days to dub this the first VOC since Delta in May, and every news site I've checked has Omicron as its top headline. --Xarm Endris (talk) 22:54, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Per TRM, 331. We have an Ongoing venue for Covid developments, and my impression is remains that not enough is known about this variant to warrant separate promotion at ITN. – Sca (talk) 23:19, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Support, this is headline news worldwide with major impact on travel, financial markets, etc. -- Tavix (talk) 23:38, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Confirmed cases already in Europe. This is an escalation. BabbaQ (talk) 23:49, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Lots of variants (including those that fizzled out) had confirmed cases in different countries in various parts of the world. As of now coverage about this variant is mostly speculation. 2607:FEA8:E31F:FBC1:2D79:6E12:60A:10C4 (talk) 15:25, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the article is written in British English, so why is the blurb being proposed with American spelling? Labeled is labelled in British English, which would be consistent with the article. This isn't American Wikipedia, no matter how much Americans want to whitewash the rest of the world. Joseph2302 (talk) 01:01, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Could you Assume Good Faith Joseph2302? No one is whitewashing anything; likely the author who proposed the blurb uses American English. I'd make the same mistake. Also, I dunno about the validity of "labeled" in British English, but in American English, "Labelled" is a valid (but less common) spelling.-- RockstoneSend me a message! 01:47, 27 November 2021 (UTC) I'll stop complaining when ITN stops getting spammed with Americanism. [2] shows my point on spellings. And we get way to many spurious, non notable ITN nominations about American stuff, compared to very little from other countries. Joseph2302 (talk) 03:07, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Well, this isn't an American story, so your complaint is irrelevant. Cut it out. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 03:52, 27 November 2021 (UTC) There'll be L to pay over this ridiculous rhubarb. – Sca (talk) 14:42, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Absolutely ridiculous rant. wow Belugsump (talk) 19:21, 27 November 2021 (UTC) So Britons seemingly hijack an article that seemingly should have been written in some form of Southern African English and then decide it's very wicked of Americans to accidentally fail to go along with this.

WaltCip-(talk) 14:28, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- this is getting attention that even the Delta variant did not get. It's the top headline worldwide (although, it is a slow news period since it's Thanksgiving/Black Friday weekend). -- RockstoneSend me a message! 01:48, 27 November 2021 (UTC) For about eight billion people worldwide, there'll be no figgy turkey and cheap electronics this weekend. Just headlines, everywhere, slowly repeating "Omicron". Omicron. InedibleHulk (talk) 04:00, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Support The existing ongoing doesn't provide anywhere near sufficient coverage in my opinion, with ctrl+f only finding the name of this variant used once. I second BabbaQ, the situation is escalating, significant, and merits separate coverage. Canadianerk (talk) 01:52, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Covered in ongoing; all we know is we don't know much yet, and like general COVID, learning more could take years. InedibleHulk (talk) 04:00, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Support several countries have already taken action in response to this variant. It is clearly highly newsworthy. Banedon (talk) 05:40, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Just as a possible alternative for the blurb, as there's nothing else on the Ongoing line presently, but this is a significant aspect to COVID we could add a parenthetical link to the Omicron variant page in Ongoing, assuming that that target is of quality. --Masem (t) 06:02, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Altblurbed If anyone knows how many those "several" are in real numbers, feel free to fill me in. I still oppose both blurbs. Just think this one is less routine advisory, more headline. InedibleHulk (talk) 06:19, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This new variant has a large probability of becoming a new pandemic, COVID-21 that will exist parallel to COVID-19. So, we're then back to square one. If we then repeat the same mistake of not containing COVID-21 using strict lockdowns like the Chinese did in Wuhan, we'll end up with the same outcome a few years later: COVID-23 and back to square one yet again. Count Iblis (talk) 06:55, 27 November 2021 (UTC) None of that somewhat alarming and rather sound advice is in the blurbs or target article, though...yet. InedibleHulk (talk) 08:35, 27 November 2021 (UTC) WP:CRYSTAL. Jehochman Talk 13:43, 27 November 2021 (UTC) ITN isn't a forum for probabilities of any size, however many alarums may divert us from editorial probity. – Sca (talk) 14:57, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Support Now this is definately IN THE NEWS — Preceding unsigned comment added by 5.44.170.26 (talk) 08:12, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose This is a WP:MEDRS matter and so unsuitable for ITN which posts uncited blurbs on a highly visible but protected page. The news is quite tentative and based on a press-release rather than solid science. The WHO statements are not consistent – that the variant is concerning but that measures such as travel bans should not be used and that we should use the alphabet to avoid stigma but not follow its order to avoid Xi. It appears that the variant will not be well understood for at least two weeks and so we will have to wait for reliable information. See also mu. Andrew?(talk) 08:51, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Variant of concern is a formal designation, and we have posted medical news plenty of times before (e.g. when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic; I'll save folks the embarrassment of digging up who opposed that one) in addition to medical TFA blurbs, so I don't think your argument that we should avoid anything MEDRS on the main page has precedent. {{u|Sdkb}}?talk 18:45, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Add to ongoing where COVID-19 is already listed. Yes places have suspended flights, but they've been doing this on and off for almost 2 years now. And it's based more on the fact they don't know enough about this variant. ALT0 is dull and doesn't explain why this needs posting, when no other variant did. ALT1 is a knee-jerk reaction to countries not knowing enough about it, that will likely be recinded in a couple of weeks. And not sure the article meets WP:MEDRS either. Joseph2302 (talk) 09:09, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose per all above. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 09:27, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Very widely reported on Saturday, with suspected cases in The Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. However, vaccine makers say tweaked Covid vaccines could be developed quickly against the Omnicron variant. [3] In the circumstances, it's too early to play Omnicron as a blurb. – Sca (talk) 13:16, 27 November 2021 (UTC) This new virus is actually mentioned all over the news. And confirmed cases is starting to be reported daily.BabbaQ (talk) 13:34, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Seems to me I've encountered the phrase "all over" all over the place lately. – Sca (talk) 15:16, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Skeptical because there is only suspicion at this point. Nothing is actually known other than that there's a new variant of concern. Unfortunately science does not lend itself to breaking news. Rather, it's a long slow progression. This can be covered in ongoing. We should not chase the latest COVID speculation, much of which eventually proves to be wrong. WHO has named 5 variants of concern, but only Alpha and Delta appear to have become dominant in their time. We do not know if Omicron will be another Delta, or if it will go the way of Gamma. How many times have we previously posted a WHO announcement about a variant of concern? If we didn't post the last five, why should we post this one? As for the alternative blurb, is the travel disruption between southern Africa and the rest of the world significant enough, or is it just more the same that's been happening here and there for the last 18 months (which would suggests this should be covered in ongoing). Jehochman Talk 13:37, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose, per TRM above. —Brigade Piron (talk) 13:39, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Support because travel between many countries has been severely adversely affected. The news of the variant caused a huge fall in the oil price & stock markets on Fri. Jim Michael (talk) 15:21, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Support Even if it turns out to be fairly harmless it has already caused significant disruption, including the cancellation of a major WTO conference in Geneva, etc. Tlhslobus (talk) 20:20, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose per Jehochman above. Unfortunately the news here is not what's IN the news, but the fact that so many ill-informed people are getting stressed and excited about something they know so little about. HiLo48 (talk) 21:42, 27 November 2021 (UTC) It's not our role to judge whether the top headlines were chosen appropriately. And I'd argue that a new variant that could prolong the pandemic, potentially leading to millions of deaths and billions in economic losses, is absolutely a story that deserves to be getting the attention it has, even if we don't know everything yet. {{u|Sdkb}}?talk 18:45, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Support. Like it or not, Omicron is THE biggest story in the world right now and that will continue to be the case for a while. Even if it turns out that the variant is not vaccine resistant, the real world implications in terms of the response by many countries have been major, and there will be further discussions either way about what to do next, including likely implications for speeding up vaccine distribution to the developing countries. We should post items to ITN based on what's actually happening rather than on what we'd like people to think. Nsk92 (talk) 01:08, 28 November 2021 (UTC) As I hinted at above, the news here is not so much the existence of this variant, but the fact that so many ill-informed people are getting stressed and excited about something they know so little about. HiLo48 (talk) 05:10, 28 November 2021 (UTC) I follow the experts that says that the new variant is highly dangerous and even have basically closed down the UK and South Africa. Excited? come on.BabbaQ (talk) 09:25, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Indeed, as we can read here: "The variant harbors a high number of mutations in regions of the spike protein that antibodies recognize, potentially dampening their potency. “Many mutations we know are problematic, but many more look like they are likely contributing to further evasion,” says Moore. There are even hints from computer modelling that B.1.1.529 could dodge immunity conferred by another component of the immune system called T cells, says Moore.....Moore says breakthrough infections have been reported in South Africa among people who have received any of the three kinds of vaccines in use there, from Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer–BioNTech and Oxford–AstraZeneca. Two quarantined travellers in Hong Kong who have tested positive for the variant were vaccinated with the Pfizer jab, according to news reports. One individual had travelled from South Africa; the other was infected during hotel quarantining." Count Iblis (talk) 09:40, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Did they get severe disease, hospitalization, and death? That is what actually matters, not mild / asymptomatic infections. There were lots of cases of mild breakthrough infections with other variants. 2607:FEA8:E31F:FBC1:2D79:6E12:60A:10C4 (talk) 15:34, 28 November 2021 (UTC) If omicron escapes immunity and spreads better than delta, then this will cause the number of omicron cases to explode but without it replacing the delta variant, because immunity against omicron does not lead to immunity against delta. So, we'll then have two parallel pandemics. Because Delta alone causes capacity problems at hospitals, omicron doesn't need to be worse than delta. If it spreads more rapidly than delta, then even with a smaller hospitalization rate you can still get a huge peak in hospitalizations. Even if it is so benign that such a peak is relatively small, this will still add to the hospitalized delta-variant patients, so even in that case it will be bad news. Count Iblis (talk) 15:59, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Any claim that it is a complete vaccine escape variant is speculation. Lots of people said the same about earlier variants like the mu variant and beta variant, there was a drop in neutralization effectiveness but the vaccine was still effective. 2607:FEA8:E31F:FBC1:2D79:6E12:60A:10C4 (talk) 16:28, 28 November 2021 (UTC) A suggestion to those who support posting this: try reframing the blurb. The news here is not a science story, but it might be a social story about governments panicking (or grandstanding) after being burned before. Unfortunately the travel bans will solve nothing because this variant has already dispersed, and the variant doesn't care whether somebody is a citizen of one country or another. (The travel bans have exemptions allowing expatriates to return home.) If it's bad, it's going to trigger another wave. If it's not that bad, then this is much ado about nothing. We cannot know at this time which scenario will follow. Jehochman Talk 13:30, 28 November 2021 (UTC) There is now an altblurb to that effect, but the problem is that there are a large number of small consequences, which arguably justify posting collectively but probably not individually (the current altblurb is mentioning what arguably looks like "just another travel ban, which happen all the time"), and it's seemingly hard to phrase an altblurb to say this acceptably. Tlhslobus (talk) 18:08, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Coverage about this variant is mostly speculation. Not everything is bad, for instance there are preliminary reports that this variant tends to produce less severe infections (like the other stuff, this is preliminary, it will take time to confirm or disprove). Many of the support votes are speculating, see WP:CRYSTAL. 2607:FEA8:E31F:FBC1:2D79:6E12:60A:10C4 (talk) 15:30, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Time to close? I'm a 'Support' but, if I have not miscounted, I make the current count 13 Supports to 11 Opposes (counting the Skeptical and Add to Ongoing as Opposes), so seemingly not much likelihood of a 2 to 1 Supermajority for posting, and closing may help editors focus their efforts on more productive work. Tlhslobus (talk) 18:08, 28 November 2021 (UTC) An unsuccessful close would be yet another piece of evidence that In the News is utterly incapable of actually posting news. There is a slim majority supporting, but this is not a vote, and I think the opposes are largely uncompelling: they say it's just speculation, ignoring the fact that just the reaction to the speculation alone is notable enough to be the top headline worldwide. {{u|Sdkb}}?talk 18:45, 28 November 2021 (UTC) One more oppose, per Andrew, TRM.

And blurb seems incorrect, as Australia were invited in, they didn't take over. Joseph2302 (talk) 03:03, 27 November 2021 (UTC) I used the term "take over" because that's the term used by Reuters and Australian Financial Review. I added an alt blurb for clarification.Scaramouche33 (talk) 06:10, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Sadly the AFR is now owned by Rupert Murdoch, a man who has always had a stronger interest in stirring political troubles rather than reporting facts. Using it as a source is little better than using Fox "News". Reuters may well have simply copied the language used the AFR.

There is more than enough continuing international coverage e.g WaPo, CNN, NYT, Al Jazeera, Guardian, etc. The intervention of Australian troops already makes it much more than an internal unrest story. Plus most of the properties burned are apparently China owned businesses and there are likely to be implications for China's Belt and Road projects in the Solomon Islands. Nsk92 (talk) 02:21, 28 November 2021 (UTC) The Australian Federal Police is NOT Australian troops.

And we need different sources. HiLo48 (talk) 07:29, 28 November 2021 (UTC) CNN explicitly says that both Australian police and Defense Force have been deployed. Nsk92 (talk) 10:43, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Then the proposed blurb is wrong. HiLo48 (talk) 21:45, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Neutral on Posting, but, if we do post, Support Altblurb (or variants) and Oppose Blurb: The blurb makes it look like "Australian Imperialism", which it seemingly isn't (although it may well eventually come to be perceived as such by many, as happened, for instance, with British intervention in Northern Ireland in 1969, and with the Indian intervention in Sri Lanka that eventually led to Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, but we're not in the Crystal Ball business). I may or may not add an altblurb that mentions the Australian Defence Forces per above discussion, although the altblurb may then get a bit long.Tlhslobus (talk) 19:05, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Support: Switching from neutral on posting to Support, after giving further thought to the geopolitical aspects, as this seems to be a clear instance of Sino-US rivalry in action.

Article: Murder of Ahmaud Arbery (talk · history · tag) Blurb: All three men, George McMichael, Travis McMichael, and William Bryan Jr., are found guilty in the Murder of Ahmaud Arbery (Post) News source(s): CNN, The New York Times BBC Credits: Nominated by Andise1 (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: Ending to a major court case related to racial issues in the US. Andise1 (talk) 20:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Is it really necessary to discuss such a case again? I refer to here. Yet another case with zero international impact and interest, yet another case of a purely local trial. Far from being akin to the conviction for the murder of George Floyd. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alsoriano97 If "international impact" was required for postings, very little would be posted. 331dot (talk) 20:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, but it should be much more decisive when it comes to court rulings than in other cases (sports, science, elections...). If the follow-up of a trial has a very low international coverage/interest, will you tell me that it's not an important requirement to take into account when determining whether a court case is blurb-worthy or not? So many people are condemned every day in this world... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Respectfully, we aren't talking about someone convicted of robbing the corner store, but a black man who was murdered basically for being in the wrong neighborhood in a part of the United States where convictions for this sort of thing are rare. And as I said, this incident has influenced changes in laws. 331dot (talk) 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, laws of a single U.S. state (as far as I know). If it were at the federal level I might come to support it, but not at this one. And many are the events that trigger legislative changes. And without a doubt, the article is in excellent shape. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 22:35, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This was a highly followed trial in the US, and even before the verdict this incident resulted in changes in Georgia law(the elimination of citizens' arrests). 331dot (talk) 20:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Article is also of decent quality from what I can see. 331dot (talk) 20:57, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- this verdict is likely to influence future trials of this type in the United States, and it is an historic decision in an area of the country known for its virulent racism. I doubt a jury would have reached this verdict in that area even 20 years ago. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support High profile case with notable legal impact, quality article. SpencerT•C 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This is a newsworthy verdict, and the article is in good shape from a skim-through. -- Tavix (talk) 21:56, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose people found guilty of crime that they themselves were stupid enough to video. Seriously. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:18, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose It's gotten a lot of attention for emotional reasons, and on a human level the crime was shocking. But its long-term significance is likely to be minimal. People are murdered every day all over the world. Some get a lot of press attention. We almost never post them. -Ad Orientem (talk) 22:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's already had long term significance, both legally and perhaps socially. This was not a garden variety murder. I don't understand this line of thinking more generally. If this event is not notable due to not having "long term significance", it should be proposed for deletion. 331dot (talk) 22:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all, there does exist a middle ground between ITN and AFD. This is a prime example. It's the result of a clear-cut murder case which the perps videoed themselves. A no-brainer. What would have been newsworthy would have been this ending in a non-guilty verdict and the no-doubt ensuing riots. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:34, 24 November 2021 (UTC) They taped it because they were in their mind attempting to make a citizens arrest(which was banned after this incident) even though they had no evidence of a crime. And in Georgia and elsewhere this is, rightly or wrongly, not clear cut. Even 15 years ago these men might have got off. And there was doubt Derek Chauvin would be convicted for killing George Floyd even though that was on video. 331dot (talk) 22:45, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, it's nuanced and emotive but ultimately it's just another crime story. It's been whipped up with publicity and is precisely the reason that we need to apply some common sense to these kinds of nominations. It is of minimal long term significance. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:49, 24 November 2021 (UTC) If this crime had occurred in the 1960s or earlier with the same verdict, I'd support posting due to its obvious significance. But it's not 1961. It's 2021 and in this day and age racial lynchings, when they happen, typically end up with long jail sentences. The man was murdered. His killers were tried and convicted in open court. Where's the long term significance? Again, this is not 1961 where there would have been a great deal of shock at this outcome. -Ad Orientem (talk) 23:35, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Then it should be proposed for deletion. I am going to now withdraw from this discussion as I am finding it frustrating that we are drifting away from our mission here. This is on me and me alone, no one else. 331dot (talk) 23:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think there is any question that this passes WP:EVENT and GNG. But ITN has traditionally had higher standards for posting events. -Ad Orientem (talk) 03:31, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly right. There is a middle ground between AFD and ITN, and this article falls squarely in there. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 07:54, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is in good shape, well referenced, and story is currently being adequately covered by reliable sources. Meets all requirements. --Jayron32 22:38, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Similar to the Rittenhouse verdict - limited notability, outcome that isn't nationally or globally significant in any game-changing or important way. Prism55 (talk) 23:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose This wasn't a case with the same scope as the George Floyd killing , it had no ties to terrorism and did not create any major unrest from the original event (nor the verdict), and outside of the event, none of these people are notable. This is the type of thing we absolutely should NOT be posting to ITN. --Masem (t) 23:51, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I vehemently disagree with the idea that there must be global protests and riots in order to post a highly notable criminal conviction. We are supposed to follow the news at least somewhat and we have a great article to feature. 331dot (talk) 23:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This isn't a notable criminal conviction - all parties involved are BLP1E. It's a highly-covered story, but given the bias our sources have towards US-based stories, this is not a surprise. And no, we're not supposed to follow the news - we aren't a news ticker. That's what the Current Events page is for. --Masem (t) 23:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose this kind of case is fairly common in the US. The focus tends to be on race, not on the facts of the case or the law. If the focus were on the last, then perhaps the law might change in which case there is a long-term impact; since it isn't, if we post this we might as well put "bias in the United States legal system" or some similar article into ongoing. Banedon (talk) 02:18, 25 November 2021 (UTC) The law did change in Georgia in response Arbery's murder. The Georgia legislature repealed their statute allowing for citizen's arrest. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 03:11, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Hmm. It's still only one state though. I would prefer to see something at country level. Banedon (talk) 03:24, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Every Black Lives Matter adjacent case isn’t news for the In The News section, unless we come to a consensus that Black Lives Matter should be given special consideration for the section. Trillfendi (talk) 04:40, 25 November 2021 (UTC) No, we shouldn't be doing that, as it's a WP:BIAS towards American news stories. Joseph2302 (talk) 10:43, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose we don't need to post every murder verdict on ITN. If this wasn't an American murder trial, it wouldn't even be considered here.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 13:33, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Was asking Amakuru. – Sca (talk) 13:41, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Well perhaps next time start chatting on his talk page. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 15:11, 25 November 2021 (UTC) I wasn't "chatting," I was asking a question relevant to ENGVAR usage. (Kindly desist from tutelage, however well meant. Thank you ever so much, TRM.) – Sca (talk) 19:00, 25 November 2021 (UTC) I responded knowing the ENGVAR used by Amakuru would allow "whilst". And in any case, you asked "whilst" in general in your opening post. Good grief. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 19:02, 25 November 2021 (UTC) WP:TLW – Sca (talk) 19:10, 25 November 2021 (UTC) almost. Martinevans123 (talk) 19:16, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Not quite. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 19:32, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Since it seems my answer is required here, I'm pretty sure I do sometimes say "whilst" in conversation. There are times when it scans better in the sentence than "while". — Amakuru (talk) 22:19, 25 November 2021 (UTC) I only use that word whilst trying to educate lesser breeds without the law.

This article is inflated by an overly long background section with tangential relevance to this event (and which is covered in the article on the wider issue anyway), and too many reactions for an article of this size. Joseph2302 (talk) 13:37, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Agree. – Sca (talk) 13:43, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Question Is this a particularly unusual or notable event? I'm think of SIEV-X. Hawkeye7 (discuss) 22:10, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Yes for a crossing of the Channel, but not globally. 2A00:23C7:2B86:9800:61E1:D1B1:168:D0F4 (talk) 23:00, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, there have been several capsize events in the Med around Lampadusa but this is the worst such event in the Channel for a long time. The one you note was 20 years ago. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 23:13, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Support once the issues are resolved.

Still too thin (and topic is getting stale). – Sca (talk) 13:36, 26 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all, the topic is front and centre in Europe, and has caused issues between France and the UK.

If there have been significant updates in the last week, these should be added, but right now, this article fails the ongoing criteria.

The migrants have been moved away from the border and the situation has calmed down. No longer an ongoing event. Modest Genius talk 13:05, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Although the situation appears to have been at least partially defused, there have been reports in recent days that in some cases Belorussian guards have continued to help migrants breach the border into Polish territory. [7], [8] [9] – Sca (talk) 13:27, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Removal from ongoing is based on the article being updated frequently, which isn't the case here.

Joseph2302 (talk) 10:42, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Remove the existence of news coverage that Sca notes is a necessary but not sufficient condition for maintaining an ongoing link.

News source(s): BBC Credits: Nominated by BastianMAT (talk · give credit) Article updated The nominated event is listed on WP:ITN/R, so each occurrence is presumed to be important enough to post. Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article and update meet WP:ITNCRIT, not the significance. Nominator's comments: ITNR, as it falls under "Changes in the holder of the office which administer the executive of their respective state/government, in those countries which qualify under the criteria above, as listed at List of current heads of state and government except when that change was already posted as part of a general election". First female prime minister of Sweden. BastianMAT (talk) 09:59, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment she takes office on the 26th (according to her article). Until that point, the blurb isn't correct, as she only becomes the first female PM of Sweden on that date. Is it usual to post when it's announced, or when they take office? Joseph2302 (talk) 10:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Usually when they are elected but yeah with the blurb of being elected. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support - First female PM in Sweden. But change blurb to ”is elected” instead becomes.BabbaQ (talk) 10:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Significant as new PM and first female. Perhaps the blub should be "elected by the Riksdag" since she didn't gain office through a normal election (by the people). cart-Talk 10:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) That's normal in a parliamentary system. – Sca (talk) 15:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should probably start with "Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, ..." to provide context, since this was not an election outcome but a government reshuffle. --Tone 10:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support now the blurb has been changed to "is elected" seems fine to run now. Agree with Tone that we should make it clearer that this wasn't an election that caused this.

The Center Party (liberal) voted for the opposition’s budget and it got through. The Center party did not agree with the goverment’s budget, stating it was way too left. That would mean Magdallena now has to rule with right wing economic politics, which she accepted. However their junior party the Green party did not accept it and have left the goverment meaning a new Riksdag election for the prime minister post shall be held. Interesting development. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update 2 by nominator Magdallena Andersson has officially resigned. We might have to pull the news back as she won’t be assuming office. She will only assume office if she wins a new prime minister vote, which might take place in a few days/weeks, depending on how the talks with the speaker goes. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull (or update the blurb). Her resignation is quickly making international news. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 17:38, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update blurb Move over Kim Campbell, there's a new sheriff in town.

However much she has resigned. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 18:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) What updating with "and immediately resigns" or something?

It will work until she is finally elected the new PM in a few days or at the longest a week.BabbaQ (talk) 20:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Hopefully, we'll have an update about her taking office soon. That would be a simple update to do. --PFHLai (talk) 20:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull -- wait until she actually is seated. She just resigned. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:22, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The blurb already says that. It's fine. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's probably just my own bias here; but it seems silly to post this when she just resigned. Forming coalition governments in a parliamentary system is weird. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:45, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's a fascinating and encyclopedic story. Unlike the myriad legal cases being spewed out of the US these days. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support new/current blurb ("Magdalena Andersson resigns shortly after being elected as the first female prime minister of Sweden.")

Just saying. 331dot (talk) 08:19, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This may be ITN/R per "first ... launches of any type of rocket" as it's the first mission to use the NEXT drive but that's debatable. Andrew?(talk) 10:09, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The NEXT is the thruster on the spacecraft, not the rocket that put it up there(a Falcon 9). 331dot (talk) 12:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Such missions usually have multiple stages and each stage has separate rocket engines. The first stage is usually more spectacular but there's no scientific reason to prefer it. For deep space missions lasting years, the efficiency of the final spacecraft will be most important and this is a new design. Andrew?(talk) 12:54, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important global mission (even if it does sound like DART is copying the plot of Salvation (TV series)). Added 3 cn tags to article, but apart from that, it looks more than good enough article quality for the front page. Joseph2302 (talk) 09:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Everyone in the world should be happy we'll finally have a way to stop any doomsday asteroids from wiping us all out. Dream Focus 11:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) If it works, of course... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support is ITNR from what Andrew says and the global impact of this mission is undoubted, so it's clearly notable. In fact I think it should be one of the most important scientific news of the year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Global impact?? I thought the idea was to avoid that! Martinevans123 (talk) 13:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This event can't be notable, its only impact is on a small unpopulated asteroid! WaltCip-(talk) 14:17, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Impactfulness nonapparent at this pt. in time & space. – Sca (talk) 15:00, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the proposed blurb is a mess. I've added alt1, though for some reason that's messing up the template formatting - I can't work out why. Modest Genius talk 13:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, this is not ITNR, as it's not a new type of rocket and interplanetary probes are ITNR when they arrive at their destination, not when launched. But the gap here is long enough (ten months) that it's reasonable to post both launch and arrival. Modest Genius talk 13:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) @Modest Genius: I fixed the formatting issue. Adding italics to either of the blurbs breaks it, because italics are already applied by default.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The fact that the mission is attempting to alter the course of the asteroid makes this particularly notable. Added alt2. Polyamorph (talk) 13:40, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alt2 is incorrect. It won't 'deflect the course' of the asteroid. The impact will modify orbit of the moon around the asteroid, not either of their orbits around the Sun. Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Dimorphos is an asteroid (albeit a minor one compared to Didymos). It will deflect its course. Nothing to do with the Sun. Polyamorph (talk) 13:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It may deflect its course. – Sca (talk) 15:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It will deflect it, even if by only a negligible amount. But this is covered by the wording of alt2 "on a mission to attempt to deflect the course". Polyamorph (talk) 15:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – From what I've seen, this is such a complicated, long-term project that any significant results may be years off. – Sca (talk) 13:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - no mention of Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck or Michael Bay.

This is most definitely not in the same league as 2016 Nice truck attack, 2016 Berlin truck attack, 2017 London Bridge attack and 2017 New York City truck attack.--Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 07:43, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- although we should wait until (at least) a suspect is released; as we still don't know what the motive was. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 08:03, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality article is just a stub. Joseph2302 (talk) 08:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not terrorism, according to "sources", so whilst tragic, it appears to be a worse-than-usual crime gone wrong. Black Kite (talk) 08:44, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- It seems that around five people died in the attack. The perpetrator has been reported by a few media outlets as Daniel Brooks, a black man who raps under the name "MathboiFly" and has tons of social media posts supporting BLM, and this was in the aftermath of a very notable event where Rittenhouse was cleared as killing two black men in self-defence. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Complete extrapolation. Police have said they believe he was on the run having committed a separate crime, nothing to do with Rittenhouse at all. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia is there to report the facts. Police and many members of the public initially considered the possibility of Islamic terrorism due to similar incidents in the past involving Muslims, the targeting of a western festival, and the recent rise in Islamic terrorist activity, but police have now confirmed that this is not terrorism related. Similarly, there have been widespread links/controversy made between the rapper and his connections to BLM, and it has been linked to Rittenhouse whether you like it or not. It is part of the story. The killer is a major supporter and activist of BLM. And this happened in the aftermath of Rittenhouse's acquittal. It's all part of the background and developing story. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:45, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all. The police have stated he was fleeing a separate scene. Conflating this with BLM/Rittenhouse is pure crystal balling. Thanks. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:47, 22 November 2021 (UTC) "two black men" and you'd think we were on a website about facts... CharredWaffle (talk) 14:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Calling this an "attack" may be a misnomer as it appears that the suspect was fleeing the police, not that it was a preplanned attack or terrorism. 331dot (talk) 12:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Maybe so. OTOH, at least one report quotes a witness as saying the vehicle seemed to be "targeting people" as it veered from side to side. Also, reports say it crashed through barriers to reach the parade, which seems to indicate that it was indeed an attack, though possibly not a pre-planned one. – Sca (talk) 16:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should (and currently does not) mention the country in which this event took place. Chrisclear (talk) 12:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - It's not at all clear that this is an act of terrorism, and thus not something that would be imminently notable.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:09, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose both on merit and article quality. As of this comment, the incident does not appear to have been a deliberate attack. I would be open to reconsideration if contrary information comes to light. Also, at present the article is little more than an oversized stub. It's not ready for the main page. -Ad Orientem (talk) 13:13, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support ... pending expansion of article, which presently comprises a mere 250 words, i.e. a stub. Seems to be the No. 1 story on main RS sites today. Note 40+ injuries. (Please spare me the de rigueur "U.S.-centric" harangue. This event is unusual and widely covered.) – Sca (talk) 14:34, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not sure this deserves to be on the main page and the article doesn't look very good. ArsenalGhanaPartey (talk) 15:31, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment If the incident turns out not to be terrorist motivated, I honestly don't see it in Main Page, and if it's , with five dead, I 'mnot very clear, although the number of injured is dantesque. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 15:51, 22 November 2021 (UTC) If this is confirmed as an unfortunate series of events with no purposeful motivating factor (driver escaping from knife fight and inadvertently ran through parade crowd), then I would agree this is not really something that should be posted. This doesn't mean motiveless events can't ever be posted but I would expect the results to be more devasting (like the various major building fires or collapses that we had). --Masem (t) 16:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, I think the same Masem. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 17:30, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wait – As an AP update seems to suggest this was the act of a lone nutcase with a record, I've withdrawn my provisonal support. However, it seems we're still in a wait situation, since nine of the injured are listed in critical condition. If the toll were to rise to double digits, we might still want to consider a blurb about this very nasty event. – Sca (talk) 18:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support if the motivation turns out to be terrorism, neutral if otherwise. Mlb96 (talk) 19:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A post – by an IT user with no other contributions – on our article's talk page posits racial motivation. Seems highly dubious at this point, though. – Sca (talk) 19:08, 22 November 2021 (UTC) See WP:RS. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 19:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Please see expanded comment above. Thanks. – Sca (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This event is in the news and the article looks to be in good shape. -- Tavix (talk) 19:38, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Since perp's been ID'd & police say he'll face five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, this is looking potentially more significant. – Sca (talk) 20:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Per The Independent this guy had a domestic dispute, and drove his car like a lunatic. Not terror-related, just an idiot behind the wheel. Not significant, tragic, but will never make the top 1000 things that happened on Planet Earth in 2021, let alone the top 250. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - a mass-casualty event, receiving international coverage (e.g., BBC), a suspect is being charged, and the article has been improved to sufficient quality. Levivich 20:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - rare (even in the US) mass-casualty event. Article quality is decent. Destroyeraa (Alternate account) 20:28, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment a road traffic accident in the US is not rare. Mass-casualty events in the US are far from rare. It's pretty obvious that giving this tragic yet non-terrorist/non-BLM/non-protest/non-deliberate accident undue prominence is not what the encyclopedia was designed to do. Of course, you can dig into the BBC website and find coverage, it's all "shock and think of the children" in the US, but the rest of the world has moved on the moment it was clear it was a sad instance of a crime somewhere else having shitty side-effects, and literally nothing more. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) The last time I remember a similar incident happened in the US was late 2017 when somebody plowed into a crowd in Virginia after a violent demonstration got broken up. We posted the event that it was tangentially related to, largely on the strength of somebody plowing their car into a crowd and killing someone. You supported posting it. Rockphed (talk) 01:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) If you're referring to Charlottesville car attack, that was about a man deliberately setting out to ram people. This is about a man trying to escape the scene of a domestic incident and getting into a road traffic accident. The two are incomparable. But good try. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:07, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Agreeing with previous posters, posting this event would seem to be giving undue weight to a tragic traffic accident. Comparison with the Charlottesville incident from several years back is unfair, given the explicitly political motivations of the earlier event. Wizardoftheyear (talk) 01:17, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Neutral and Wait Yes, with the additional details that have come to light, this is literally a domestic issue that had decidedly more tragic consequences. However, that is additional details. The initial response, and the fact there were several fatalities during a celebration, caught on camera and shared around the world before anyone knew what was going on, has made this major news and a source of intrigue. I think we need to wait to see if the news stations drop their coverage now that there is less intrigue and crisis; if it has effectively left the news cycle by end of day, take this as an oppose, but if it is still on the news banners, take this as support. Kingsif (talk) 01:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 4 of the 12 paragraphs in this article start "On November 2X". Typical anti-American bias from the Brits (which is far from rare) notwithstanding, the quality is not there yet. GreatCaesarsGhost 02:23, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Tragic, criminally-induced mass-casualty. Significant details are now known. CoatCheck (talk) 03:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wait It's very clear that there won't be consensus as is, but there may be more of one as things develop. Wait for now. DarkSide830 (talk) 03:46, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Strong Support. This is the deadliest vehicle ramming incident in the United States or Canada since 2018 and the deadliest in the US since 2017. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 07:37, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I see there's been a tragic bus crash in Bulgaria which has killed at least 45 people. It would be safe to presume that supporters of this accident would support the posting of the Bulgarian crash, right? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:09, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Nominate an article on it so that I can assess the quality. Without knowing what we are posting on the main page, it is impossible for me to know if the article is appropriate. --Jayron32 12:56, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Four hours ago.... The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 13:07, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Of course. My incompetency continues to be my defining attribute and sole notable trait. Carry on. --Jayron32 13:17, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Ha! – Sca (talk) 13:44, 23 November 2021 (UTC) There's no need to laugh. You, Sca, among all people, are fully aware of my incompetence. --Jayron32 13:50, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Comment Support – Still in the news. [12] It's a complicated story but a notable event, IMO. Leaning toward support, for all the diff that would make here. – Sca (talk) 13:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support for multiple fatalities, high number of serious injuries, and widespread news coverage. Jehochman Talk 13:50, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose A tragic event, but it is not a mass-casualty event. ArsenalGhanaPartey (talk) 14:11, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - We have support and oppose !votes that directly contradict each other in terms of the notability of this event. Some say this is very notable. Others say this is not at all notable. How is an admin supposed to derive consensus from this? --WaltCip-(talk) 15:05, 23 November 2021 (UTC) By executive fiat. – Sca (talk) 15:44, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Well most of the support votes are from Americans (of those who have userpages), and almost all of the opposes are from non-Americans. So I guess it'll be a coin toss on whether an American or non-American admin decides... Joseph2302 (talk) 15:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) How about one from a neutral country, say Liechtenstein? – Sca (talk) 16:19, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I voted to oppose as an American ArsenalGhanaPartey (talk) 16:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oh, you must be from Manchester, N.H., then. – Sca (talk) 16:24, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. This at first got attention because it might have been terrorism related, no problem there. But all we are left with now is an accident which leaves 5 death: while tragic, this is sadly an everyday occurrence. We have e.g. this week a ferry accident in Sri Lanka (at least 6 death)[13], 7 death in Greece when migrants flee the police[14], 22 deaths on Lake Kivu[15], nine deaths in a fire in Bulgaria[16], 10 deaths in China after a car crash[17], ... I see no reason to post this, as it is not exceptional, has no lasting importance, and isn't even very interesting (without the terrorism angle). It's a sad tragedy, but a very common one. Fram (talk) 17:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I think it is WP:TOOSOON to make a determination as to whether this was an act of terror or not. Terrorism or not, the ramming appears to be deliberate, and it has made national and international headlines. Aasim (talk) 06:53, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Per Fram, tragic, but not significant enough at a global scale: we don't even have articles about many similar tragedies elsewhere. Vanamonde (Talk) 17:45, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Sad but ephemeral. Ericoides (talk) 07:07, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The discussion above is closed. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page.

(Pulled) 2021 Bulgarian general election (presidential second round)[edit] Article: 2021 Bulgarian general election (talk · history · tag) Blurb: In Bulgaria, Rumen Radev (pictured) is re-elected President of Bulgaria. (Post) Alternative blurb: Rumen Radev (pictured) is re-elected President of Bulgaria. News source(s): Reuters, Aljazzera, Politico Credits: Updated and nominated by BastianMAT (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: Second round of the presidental election, ITNR (being part of the general elections), Radev has been declared winner with a landslide. BastianMAT (talk) 01:05, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support. Major election in an EU member state. – Illegitimate Barrister (talk • contribs), 02:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Question Do we post presidential elections even if the president has mostly symbolic roles? Scaramouche33 (talk) 07:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, heads of state elections are posted even if they are ceremonial/wield little power, it mostly depends on the article quality itself which should be more than sufficient. Two examples are the Italian presidental election and Czech presidental election, both having similar powers to the Bulgarian one. [18] [19] BastianMAT (talk) 09:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Weak support this article has been on front page for a week already, but I guess the second round presidency vote means that it's ITN eligible again. Article looks to have been sufficiently updated about the presidential second round vote. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:10, 22 November 2021 (UTC) This is not ITNR. We no longer post all elections for head of state- we post the election/choosing of the official with actual executive power, according to List of current heads of state and government; in Bulgaria that is the PM, not the president. 331dot (talk) 12:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In which case, I oppose this nomination, and it shouldn't have been tagged as ITNR. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:37, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fairness, it is a recent change that not everyone may be aware of. 331dot (talk) 12:41, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Alright, I thought going by older posts that head of state elections are still part of ITNR but if its been removed, no problem and thanks for the headsup for future nominations. BastianMAT (talk) 12:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I just saw this now. I must have missed the change or forgot about it. So my comment on other presidents is not relevant here. --Tone 17:49, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, that’s what got me confused to when I ITNR nominated this. In the past as you and I mentioned, similar head of state elections (with similar powers) such as Moldova(November 2020), Germany, Austria, Italy, Czech Republic have been posted. 331dot said the removal of ceremonial head of state elections from ITNR were ’recently’ done, so the change must have not been too long ago for us to not know that.BastianMAT (talk) 18:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Blurb on MainPage was updated and moved up --PFHLai (talk) 13:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) PFHLai there wasn't consensus to do this update- the presidential election is not ITNR, and there was not consensus here that it's important enough for ITN. We should leave it where it is, so it can roll off soon, instead of moving it up so it'll stay on ITN for another week... Joseph2302 (talk) 13:27, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Post posting support If the election was stand-alone, we would probably post it. This is just the case where the general election were held together with the first round of presidential, so there is a single article. I don't see a problem. --Tone 14:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I doubt we would post this as a standalone item. He may be head of state, but he has no power. It's the Prime Minister of Bulgaria who would be posted automatically. — Amakuru (talk) 17:18, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fact he has been in de facto power since the 2021 April elections as he appointed his friend as acting prime minister. The de jure power he wields is similar to those in Italy and Czech Republic, where he gets to nominate the prime minister and supreme court judges, he can veto laws (although parliament can override) and he of course serves as head of state, don’t forget Bulgaria even has a vice president. In the past we have posted the Italian presidental and Czech Republic presidental elections, both are parliamantary republics too. I thought it was ITNR, but 331dot mentioned that head of state elections (where the head of state is not head of goverment) was recently removed from ITNR. Italian presidental election posted Czech Republic presidental election posted BastianMAT (talk) 17:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) (ec) As far as I remember we post both if the articles are ok. We've posted presidents of Austria and Germany, which have a similar role, for example. Furthermore, the president of Germany is elected by Bundestag, not by a popular vote. --Tone 17:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and Revert back to previous version per Joseph2302. This guy is just a figure head, and we already posted the main election result. There was no reason to have bumped this up, and the result is not ITN/R so needs consensus, which it doesn't have. — Amakuru (talk) 17:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and agree with above, not seeing consensus here for this to have even been posted in the first instance. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Beyond the issue of whether it should be on the main page, the blurb is clumsy. "In Bulgaria," is redundant. Where else but in Bulgaria would you be elected President of Bulgaria? Schwede66 17:57, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Restored old blurb. --PFHLai (talk) 18:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull Not a head of state change but in the same spirit This post was made by orbitalbuzzsaw gang (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I think we need some kind of page break to restart voting. A lot of the opposition above was to the unilateral action and not the nom itself. as for me, Oppose while there are some states with significant power invested in the secondary office, this is not one of them. GreatCaesarsGhost 21:55, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't particularly mind about the unilateral action myself - it was made in good faith - and my oppose is purely on the merits of the case, for much the same reasons as you. I suggest we move on from this. — Amakuru (talk) 10:45, 23 November 2021 (UTC) References[edit] Nominators often include links to external websites and other references in discussions on this page.
