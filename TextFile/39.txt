Summary DescriptionLittle Amal at Barnsley 30 October 2021 (46).JPG This is Little Amal, a 3.5 m (11 ft) animatronic puppet which represents a 9-year-old Syrian refugee girl who is on a walk from Syria to the United Kingdom to find her mother. The travelling event from Syria to the UK was called The Walk, and was organised by Good Chance and the Handspring Puppet Company. This set of photographs was taken at Wentworth Castle near Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England. The puppet is controlled by three puppeteers: one to each hand, and one inside on stilts. Little Amal starts to make her way towards the Wentworth Castle Folly and the Rope of Hope. You can see all three puppeteers in this picture.
