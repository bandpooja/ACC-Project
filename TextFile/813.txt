Creating a new article is one of the hardest things to do on Wikipedia, especially if you've never edited Wikipedia before. To learn how to edit, you could view Help:Introduction and The Wikipedia Adventure. I suggest then spending a significant amount of time editing existing articles to hone your skills. Once you're ready to create an article, you would gather independent reliable sources that have provided significant coverage of the subject, and determine whether it meets Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion, called "notability". If so, you could follow the instructions at Help:Your first article, and be prepared for a process that may include months of waiting, rejections, and rewrites, before an article is created. Hope this helps, and happy editing! GoingBatty (talk) 04:40, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Reference tag appeared.[edit] Hi Folks!! Does anybody know why this Dorothee Poelchau comes up with sources tag needed. It is a search URL to get the record validating the claim, but it shouldn't spin up a tag with that, surely? Its not even a BLP. Thanks. scope_creepTalk 10:47, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Got it fixed. It was the spelling again. scope_creepTalk 10:52, 27 November 2021 (UTC) AFC Drafts[edit] Draft:Kewsong Lee Draft:Song Zhuo Qun I understand AFC articles can take a while to process but I'm not sure why one of them is 2 weeks into submission with no one looking at them. Quite a lot of articles launched this date have already been reviewed. Its not like either article is very long, controversial or difficult to check either. -Imcdc (talk) 15:18, 27 November 2021 (UTC) As it says, very clearly: "Review waiting, please be patient. This may take 2 months or more, since drafts are reviewed in no specific order. There are 2,700 pending submissions waiting for review." --David Biddulph (talk) 15:21, 27 November 2021 (UTC) @Imcdc: Like other editors, reviewers are unpaid volunteers who are self-selected and under no centralized control. Each reviewer does whatever task they wish to do at whatever time they wish to do it. Some reviewers may choose to work from oldest to newest, while others will refrain from working on certain types of article like BLP or political articles, and others may work only on topics with which they are familiar. -Arch dude (talk) 16:15, 27 November 2021 (UTC) my edit[edit] hello some has removed my edit to a wikipedia page about st anthony’s girls catholic academy. as an ex pupil i have shared helpful information about this school that may help many people. i wish for my edit to be re added. thank you 82.132.237.15 (talk) 17:22, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia does not summarize personal knowledge or opinions. Please use a more appropriate forum such as social media to give your views about something. You may be blocked if you make further edits like the one you did. 331dot (talk) 17:26, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Help with redirecting index search[edit] Please help me redirect non-existing word to existing page. For example, linking non-existing word "A" to existing page called "B", pointing "B" when I searched "A". The Supermind (talk) 18:58, 27 November 2021 (UTC) @The Supermind: Hi there!

GoingBatty (talk) 19:45, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Image display trouble[edit] How come the illustration "Roman Hall of Justice" at Persecution_of_Christians_in_the_Roman_Empire#Reasons,_causes_and_contributing_factors is not displayed properly?--Hildeoc (talk) 19:09, 27 November 2021 (UTC) @Hildeoc: It looks OK to me. Could you please specify what is not correct and what you would like to be different? Thanks! GoingBatty (talk) 19:46, 27 November 2021 (UTC) @GoingBatty: Thank you very much for your interest. I've tried with several browsers, and for the embedment in the article, I only get a white field displayed instead of the image. Hope this helps. Best--Hildeoc (talk) 20:00, 27 November 2021 (UTC) It appears as a broken image for me as well. It shows normally on Commons, but its thumbnail there is also broken for me. Isabelle ? 20:01, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Same here; the "Persecution of the Christians" image in that article, from the same source, also isn't displaying. Wikignome Wintergreentalk 20:08, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, both images mentioned by Wikignome Wintergreen aren't showing up for me either. Does anyone know what would cause this? There haven't been any recent changes to the article here or to either of the images on Commons. --Zander251 (talk) 20:15, 27 November 2021 (UTC) MediaWiki is apparently unable to scale File:Young Folks' History of Rome illus378.png. I don't know whether the problem is in MediaWiki or the uploaded image breaks some png rule. Maybe GoingBatty has selected 400px as thumbnail size at Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-rendering. That is the only option above the upload size 334px. MediaWiki doesn't enlarge images and would display the original upload with that setting, like the file page. It works for me when I try 400px but not smaller sizes. PrimeHunter (talk) 20:21, 27 November 2021 (UTC) This looks like an instance of phab:T285875 to me, where broken files cause scaling to fail. I've uploaded a fixed version that'll hopefully work, though if I'm reading that task correctly it take a bit before the servers try scaling the new version. Rummskartoffel 22:39, 27 November 2021 (UTC) @PrimeHunter: My preferences have thumbnail size of 220px. I'm viewing the page on my Windows 10 PC with the latest version of Google Chrome. It also looks good to my on my iPhone in the Wikipedia App and the mobile view in Safari. GoingBatty (talk) 00:20, 28 November 2021 (UTC) The first image is now displaying correctly (thanks Rummskartoffel!) but the second (here) still needs a fix and reupload. I'd do it, but I'm not sure what exactly the fix was. Wikignome Wintergreentalk 00:40, 28 November 2021 (UTC) I used the pngfix tool included with libpng, as described in the phab task. A number of other images in c:Category:Young Folks' History of Rome are also affected. I'll go take care of #315 and maybe a few more. Rummskartoffel 11:14, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Accidentally submitted article for review[edit] I'm trying to work in my sandbox but somehow I submitted it for review with just "Testing testing" How do I pull it from review? — Preceding unsigned comment added by Data Storyteller (talk • contribs) 20:30, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Data Storyteller I've reversed it for you. You can simply go into the page edit history to undo any edit. 331dot (talk) 20:34, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia app on Windows 11[edit] When I installed Windows 11 home edition, it came with a bunch of pre-installed applications (whatsapp, adobe lightroom, etc). One of those is a Wikipedia app. Is this a Wikipedia-written app or a Microsoft-written app? How is using this app different from just going to the Wikipedia web page? Is Wikipedia paying Microsoft to include this app? If so, how much? 21:04, 27 November 2021 (UTC)2600:1700:D0A0:21B0:2DBE:910C:7658:2BDA (talk) There are quite a few "Wikipedia apps". See List of Wikipedia mobile applications. "Wikipedia" is not an organization and therefore does not pay anybody anything. The Wikipedia web sites are hosted and supported by the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), which is a non-profit. I have not researched this, but I would be astonished if WMF paid anyone to put any "Wikipedia app" anywhere. -Arch dude (talk) 23:21, 27 November 2021 (UTC) It is written by the Wikimedia Foundation. See https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/wikipedia/9wzdncrfhwm4 Getting it on the Microsoft Store would have cost the Wikimedia Foundation a $99 one-time fee. I have no idea how much Microsoft charges to add an app to Windows itself. Clearly Microsoft didn't add Disney's streaming service as an included app or a link to Kohl's on the Edge opening page for free. The question is whether they decided to include the app from the Wikimedia Foundation on every copy of Windows for free because they like us, whether we paid full price, or somewhere in between. I see no reason why the Wikimedia Foundation wouldn't be willing to pay a reasonable price for that as part of their marketing budget. Does anyone have a real answer rather than a guess? I can do my own guessing. Does the Wikimedia Foundation publish how much they spend on promotion? 76.216.220.191 (talk) 02:57, 28 November 2021 (UTC) This is the help desk for the English-language Wikipedia, where you can get answers about how to use or edit the English Wikipedia. It is not the reference desk, nor is it the customer support site or public information office for the Wikimedia foundation. I suggest you read our article on the Wikimedia Foundation, and if you need additional information, go the foundation's web site that is listed there. Since WMF is a US-based 501(c)(3) organization, you can also access their IRS Form 990, which is a matter of public record. The volunteers over at the Wikipedia:Reference desk might be able to help you. -Arch dude (talk) 07:50, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Draft:Grub Hill Church, Virginia[edit] First time ever trying to create a new redirect page, a couple of days ago, and seem to have wound up with just a page draft and not a normally accessible page. Is the "draft" status permanent, or is it waiting for an administrator (or at least a user with a regular account) to come along and kiss it so that it's no longer a frog? I know, I know, I need to create an account; I do have some non-nefarious, if not completely valid, reasons for not doing so... --2603:6081:8004:DD5:6451:2AC4:EB73:1BE (talk) 23:26, 27 November 2021 (UTC) I've moved it to main space. IP users can't create pages in main space, even redirects. I don't know if there's a formal mechanism for requesting a redirect, but you could always suggest it on the talk page of the target article. --ColinFine (talk) 23:51, 27 November 2021 (UTC) @ColinFine If you follow the WP:AFC wizard, it leads to a point where the draft is created and may be submitted for review. That works well enough. There is a mechanism for requesting the creation of a redirect. Despite my being a long term AFC reviewer I have never found the door key! Your moving it to main space was expedient and pragmatic FiddleTimtrent FaddleTalk to me 23:58, 27 November 2021 (UTC) @ColinFine and Timtrent: Another option for the future would be using Wikipedia:Articles for creation/Redirects and categories. Happy editing! GoingBatty (talk) 00:29, 28 November 2021 (UTC) November 28[edit] Unreliable source[edit] The Neahkahnie Mountain has what I believe are unreliable sources. They are the very last two sources in the article. I am not sure how to address this. I tried to put a note within the body similar to [according to whom?], but with the phrase "unreliable sources?" within the notation. This did not work. I am uncertain as to how I should flag these citations. I suppose I could be wp:bold and remove the paragraph; however, I think it is courteous to make a notation instead to give an interested editor a chance to rectify the matter. So, considering this, how should I proceed? Most kind regards,Hu Nhu (talk) 03:46, 28 November 2021 (UTC) @Hu Nhu: Hi there! Try using {{unreliable source?}}, and providing any further details on the article talk page. Happy editing! GoingBatty (talk) 04:27, 28 November 2021 (UTC) @Hu Nhu: I've cleaned up your edit a bit. You copied the tl in the wikitext of GoingBatty's link to the template above, but that is there merely to refer to the template without actually calling it. The thing to do is to follow the link to the template's documentation, which will tell you how to actually use it in an article. Deor (talk) 18:46, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Hello GoingBatty and Deor. I certainly appreciate your help. I've saved the template to my sandbox where I keep notes to myself. Most importantly, I found a reliable source for the information, updated the source, and re-wrote the paragraph accordingly. Kind regards to all,Hu Nhu (talk) 21:17, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Citing Books[edit] If I'm trying to use a book as a reference and I would like to make it easier for people to follow the reference by providing the chapter or page via URL how do I do that? Specifically with Google Books it doesn't appear that going to the specific page or chapter effects the URL at all. TipsyElephant (talk) 03:51, 28 November 2021 (UTC) @TipsyElephant: Hi there! A quick Google search found this page which describes what parameters to add to the URL. What is the URL of the book, and what is the chapter or page you want to use? GoingBatty (talk) 04:37, 28 November 2021 (UTC) How do I create an account[edit] How do I create an account — Preceding unsigned comment added by 41.114.202.139 (talk) 04:49, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Hello.

Thanks 114.76.40.3 (talk) 10:40, 28 November 2021 (UTC) I assume you have access to the relevant issue of Salut. Can you tell us the title of the article you're citing? Maproom (talk) 14:29, 28 November 2021 (UTC) That reference has been in the article since at least 2014 (I haven't gone back further). This indicates that Salut, previously Paratus (another opaque citation in the article) was the monthly newsletter of the South African Defence Force. Unless somebody has a copy, that's going to be difficult to fix. Maybe ask at the resource exchange? --ColinFine (talk) 14:45, 28 November 2021 (UTC) A chunk has disapperaed in one display, but is still there in other dislay[edit] how do I get it to show all the text ? — Preceding unsigned comment added by 81.48.227.128 (talk) 16:34, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Are you referring to this sandbox article? It sounds like a markup problem - which chunk of text is vanishing? Wikignome Wintergreentalk 17:08, 28 November 2021 (UTC) I fixed (some of?) the problem by adding " characters to some refnames where you had omitted them. Note that for simple refnames using only text, the inverted commans are not needed either in defining the name nor using it. However, if used, they must match up! You'll find it much easier to avoid this sort of error if, in the source editor, you switch on syntax highlighting, which colours various aspects of the text such as citations in different colours to the main text. There is a pen icon to the left of the word "Advanced" at the top of the edit box to toggle syntax highlighting.

Hope this helps, and happy editing! GoingBatty (talk) 18:49, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Hello @654bftr: also from me--I your post while asking for assistance myself. You might also consider going to wp:Article requests where one may request an article be written. I see that bin Mandeel bin Hazal has no article on Wikipedia, so this is an avenue open to you, too. If you could provide sources, that would be good. However, it would be much quicker for you to write the article yourself. If you have trouble while writing it--and my first article was a little troublesome--you can always ask for assistance at the wp:teahouse. They are very quick to respond and most helpful.

I could not link these names to their Wikipedia page (although I added them in xx in the field that I added to the box. 2. After approving the infobox, a warning appears: Page using Template:Infobox company with unknown parameter "Investors". How can I resolve this, and have the Investors field appear in the infobox? Many thanks, Anuti — Preceding unsigned comment added by Anutig (talk • contribs) 10:19, 29 November 2021 (UTC) The article concerned is StoreDot; your link above is broken. The template used is Template:Infobox company and there is no parameter named "| Investors". If you wished to propose the addition of a new parameter to the template, the place for such a suggestion would be Template talk:Infobox company. Apart from the merits or otherwise of such a suggestion, one detail is that the parameter names normally start with a lower case letter. --David Biddulph (talk) 10:33, 29 November 2021 (UTC) The parameter |owners= can be used to list entities with an investment in the company. Ideally, each investor should be followed with their percentage of ownership and a reference.

Can it be added to your Wikipedia from the US? Susan Forbes (great-niece) Clarence A. Forbes studied Ancient History at Bates College , where he received his Bachelor's degree with honors in 1922 . He continued his studies at the University of Illinois , where he received his master's degree in 1924 and his doctorate in 1928 . On September 1, 1924, he married Florence Lemaire, with whom he had three daughters and two sons (Jacqueline, Charmian, Rodney, Roland and Joyce). From 1925 to 1927 he worked as a lecturer at the University of Cincinnati for the next 20 years he worked as an Associate Professor of Classics at the University of Nebraska, where he was awarded his honorary Doctor of Letters. In 1948 he moved to Ohio State University as Full Professor of Classics , where he retired in 1971. Forbes' main research interests were the history of sport and ancient social history. Among other things, he wrote the monograph Greek Physical Education (first edition 1929, reprint 1971). Forbes was elected President of the Classical Association of the Middle West and South for 1950/1951 . He was also a member of the North American Society for Sport History , which made him Honorary President in 1984. Fonts (selection) Greek Physical Education , New York 1929. Reprinted 1971. Neoi.

Forbes [de] Maproom (talk) 16:52, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Hello, Susan. When you ask "Can it be added to your Wikipedia", the question you are really asking is "Is there a volunteer editor who is interested enough to put in the cosiderable amount of work required to create an article about Forbes in English Wikipedia?" There might be, but there are no guarantees. The formal place to make such a request is at Requested articles, but the take-up there is very low. You might possibly have more luck asking at WT:WikiProject Sports, or WT:WikiProject History, I don't know. Something you might do to make this project more attractive to a volunteer is to do some of the legwork yourself: An article should be almost entirely based on information published by people unconnected with ths subject (there can be a list of selected works of his in an article, but they do not contribute to establishing that he meets Wikipedia's criteria for notability). The Bennett article sounds as if it is a good source (though anybody using it to write an article would need to have read it themselves). But one such source is not enough (a translation of the German Wikipedia article would not be accepted in English Wikipedia for that reason). If you can find some more (they don't have to be online, as long as they are published, and so available eg through major libraries) that will help your cause. --ColinFine (talk) 17:36, 29 November 2021 (UTC) How do you change the thumbnail of an article?[edit] Hi everybody. As the title already says, I want to change the thumbnail of an article. By "thumbnail" I mean the image that shows up next to the autocomplete suggestions of the search bar. It only appears on the large search bar of the start page (www.wikipedia.org) though, not on the small search bar in the top right corner. You can also see these thumbnails in the Wikipedia mobile app and when you use the page preview feature by hovering your cursor over Wikipedia links. I particularly want to change the thumbnail of Uluru, because right now it only shows a map of Australia. Tc14Hd (talk) 20:03, 29 November 2021 (UTC) @Tc14Hd: It's called the page image and is selected automatically. See mw:Extension:PageImages#Image choice. File:Uluru (Helicopter view)-crop.jpg has a width/height ratio which favors the map in Uluru. The selection is poor but we generally don't choose or crop images to manipulate it. PrimeHunter (talk) 23:00, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you! So apparently, there is no way to change it right now? Maybe I will write a feature request.

PrimeHunter (talk) 12:06, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Biased content on PANDAS page[edit] PANDAS (edit | talk | history | protect | delete | links | watch | logs | views) Hello, A contributor recently posted a page (PANDAS) in which they name a test (Cunningham Panel) and cite 2 studies that attempt to discredit this test. The author failed to reference and include other studies that demonstrate the clinical utility of this test. The author appears to be targeting the Cunningham Panel of tests by actually adding in quotes about the inaccuracy of this test in the reference section, next to Hesselmark et al. How can we ensure that this page is balanced with all the information and not targeting a specific test? The author of this page clearly has an agenda. Darlene Wood — Preceding unsigned comment added by DollWood (talk • contribs) 21:09, 29 November 2021 (UTC) First, I hope you understand now not to remove other editors' comments from talk pages.[1] Next, please familiarize yourself with Wikipedia's sourcing guidelines for health and medical content. There is no such thing as "2 studies that attempt to discredit this test" in the article, as Wikipedia medical content does not rely on primary sources such as "studies". You may be accustomed to internet chat boards, forums, and PANDAS or Lyme advocacy networks that do regularly report primary studies as if they were established science, but Wikipedia does not, and has higher sourcing standards for biomedical content. Wikipedia uses secondary reviews of primary sources, as the PANDAS article has done wrt to the Cunningham Panel. Those secondary reviews indicate the Cunningham Panel has been disproven by independent studies. And finally, I strongly suggest you become familiar with WP:MEAT and Template:Recruiting; this includes via Facebook and other PANDAS advocacy and network websites. Meat puppetry can result in editors being blocked from editing Wikipedia. Also, please remember to sign your talk page posts by adding four tildes ( ~~~~ ) after them.

It is because the name is misleading, the file in question is File:Logo of Avante (Ecuador).png, I'm asking for the name change because of two issues, 1: there's no organization called "Avante" in Ecuador, and 2: This logo is from a Brazilian political party, so I'm requesting the file to be renamed File:Logo of Avante (Brazil).png, you can check the article on the political party to see I'm right. Bastewasket (talk) 21:59, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Hello, Bastewasket. See WP:MOF for how to request a file be renamed. --ColinFine (talk) 22:24, 29 November 2021 (UTC) Bastewasket, you can use Twinkle (a Swiss Army knife of maintenance tagging) or LuckyRename (specialized for this job) to request file moves. — Alexis Jazz (talk or ping me) 04:09, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Done - FlightTime (open channel) 03:19, 30 November 2021 (UTC) November 30[edit] Is there a way to see the most viewed new created articles of the last week?[edit] I want to keep an overview of the huge amout of new articles.

SpinnerLaserzthe2nd (talk) 04:01, 30 November 2021 (UTC) @SpinnerLaserzthe2nd: Hi there! Talk:NOlympics LA is the best place to discuss this, so I'm glad you've already posted there. Happy editing! GoingBatty (talk) 04:59, 30 November 2021 (UTC) @GoingBatty: Don't forget the grammar too. I almost forgot, at the time when the article was new I did added sources to back it up. SpinnerLaserzthe2nd (talk) 05:03, 30 November 2021 (UTC) @SpinnerLaserzthe2nd: I see you made some grammar changes which were reverted. Per the Wikipedia:BOLD, revert, discuss cycle, your best bet would be to create a new discussion on the article's talk page that just focuses on your concerns and suggestions about the grammar. However, the grammar is moot if the article shouldn't exist. GoingBatty (talk) 05:31, 30 November 2021 (UTC) @GoingBatty: Okay. I also said that "I do not condone [or] support this organization because of the organizations they partnered" and the reason why I said this is because I added a source that partnered with the Anti Racist Action (which is a violent far-left group) and in this edit. I tried to make accurate edits as I could but it failed. Well, you can see the talk page for yourself. I want to make an unbiased version of my edit that was removed but I do not know how because when it comes to editing political articles, things can get ugly for me. SpinnerLaserzthe2nd (talk) 06:14, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Almost confused this with WP:NOLYMPICS.

WAY TOO COMPLICATED. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Drednm&oldid=1047182969 Any ideas? — Preceding unsigned comment added by Drednm (talk • contribs) 12:16, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Drednm I will move the draft to the draft space and add the information so you can submit it(it is provided if you create a draft via WP:AFC). 331dot (talk) 12:19, 30 November 2021 (UTC) It is now at Draft:Edward Lorusso. 331dot (talk) 12:22, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Hello, Drednm. Please read Your first article. Writing a Wikipedia article begins with finding several reliable sources which are independent of the subject and contain significant coverage of the subject - not blogs, wikis, forums, social media, or anything written, published, or with major input from the subject or their associates. If you do not start with several such sources then you are building a house with no foundations, and it may well fall down, wasting all your work. --ColinFine (talk) 12:38, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Another thing which you should do before you submit the draft for review is to ensure that you provide properly cited references, see Help:referencing for beginners, so that readers can see which parts of the text are supported by which references. --David Biddulph (talk) 13:08, 30 November 2021 (UTC) As it stands now, that draft is not getting accepted. Based on my quick look around, it doesn't appear the subject satisfies WP:BIO. Clarityfiend (talk) 14:34, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Citing Sources[edit] I would like to know how to cite sources for an article. I went to the beginners section, only to find more questions than answers. Thank you in advance. — Preceding unsigned comment added by Hangane (talk • contribs) 18:43, 30 November 2021 (UTC) You'll find advice at Help:Referencing for beginners, & also see WP:Reliable sources. --David Biddulph (talk) 18:45, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Most appropriate title for a building article[edit] I’m going to do a new article on a house in Birmingham. The house is called “The Homestead, 25 Woodbourne Road”. My question is whether that would be the best title, or rather, “The Homestead, 25 Woodbourne Road, Edgbaston”, along the lines of 21 Yateley Road, Edgbaston? We already have a number of “Homestead” articles, including two on historic houses. My instinct says that it would help the reader if the title had more detail, i.e. Edgbaston, but I appreciate that many readers won’t have a clue where Edgbaston is. The Historic England listing calls it “The Homestead, 25 Woodbourne Road, B17” but I don’t think part of the postcode is very useful? Any advice greatly appreciated. KJP1 (talk) 21:35, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Hello, KJP1. The relevant policy is disambiguation: we use a term in parenthesis in an article title only to distinguish the subject from others with the same name, not to give additional information. So the title should probably be The Homestead, Edgbaston. --ColinFine (talk) 22:52, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Win total of college football coach Brian Kelly[edit] I have recently contributed this edit to the LSU Tigers football page to add a reference and use a more encyclopedic tone. The previous contributor had referenced Brian Kelly as the winningest coach in Notre Dame history. The source I referenced for the hiring also makes this claim, but it takes into account 21 wins that were vacated by the NCAA. I had attempted to reference other pages to attempt to determine the standard on referring to his win total, but I've found some existing inconsistencies and I'm unsure what the "correct" answer should be. I have removed reference to his win total and the "winningest Notre Dame coach" claim from the LSU Tigers Football article for the time being to be safe. Brian Kelly's page lists his record at Notre Dame as 92-39, which does not account for his vacated wins. This would be behind the win totals of previous Notre Dame coaches Knute Rockne, Lou Holtz, and Ara Parseghian. The article for the 2021 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team and the ESPN article referenced above both use the figure of 113-40, which includes the vacated wins, and oddly enough, an extra loss (I think Kelly's page isn't counting his loss in the 2013 national championship), but both still name him the winningest HC in Notre Dame history. However, the List of Notre Dame Fighting Irish head football coaches article has an entirely different figure of 106-39, placing him one win above Rockne. I'm not certain where the 106 is coming from, but I think it might be counting his vacated wins while missing some wins from the current 2021 season. What should be the correct figure in this instance? My gut says that the correct total should be 92-40, and we shouldn't refer to him as the winningest ND coach of all time, but given the different figures used across multiple articles, plus a major external source giving him that distinction, I'm not sure, so I wanted to check on it. Has an established standard been determined for this somewhere? Jedibob5 (talk) 21:39, 30 November 2021 (UTC) First off, you're in the wrong place. This is for technical questions. You should be asking this at the Entertainment reference desk. In any case, lots of reliable sources say he's the winningest ND coach - nfl.com, CBS, NBC, Sporting News, even Notre Dame - so he is as far as Wikipedia is concerned. His record currently stands at 113-40, according to Sports Reference and some of the aforementioned sources. Barry Bonds is still considered to have hit 762 homers, despite cheating his ass off. What can you do? Clarityfiend (talk) 23:43, 30 November 2021 (UTC) What you could do is add that his total includes vacated wins. Clarityfiend (talk) 23:47, 30 November 2021 (UTC) Edit time zones[edit] Hello, I have a tradition that I make at least one Wikipedia edit every month, yet issues with that have come to a head due to time zones, in particular in April and November of this year, the former when I had accidentally forgotten that Wikipedia uses UTC for its main timekeeping and made an edit well after 7:59 Eastern Time for that month, and the latter when even though it was submitted at 6:59 Eastern Time, Wikipedia apparently disagreed and shifted it over a minute. The latter in particular honestly devastates me, as for me the impact of an error is not in its seriousness, but in its permanence—what chance do I have trying to convince a massive organization with tons of critical code to admit that I had not failed, that "yes, we incorrectly logged the time of submission for this edit" and change it accordingly? So, I have 2 questions, of wildly different difficulty: How would I change how edit times are displayed on my end, for the Watchlist, Contributions, Page Histories, and Edit Count? Hypothetically, what would I have to do in order to actually change the logged date and time for an edit? What rank and/or position would I have to get into? Thanks.
