 (each weather variable listed in turn). I need to combine 1) and 3) - using the date and something like data_long <- merge(LST_data,weather_data,by="Date") I think - appending weather data columns to each row in 1). But I'm stuck. r Share Follow asked 4 hours ago strangecharmstrangecharm 6177 bronze badges 1 I personally would prefer my weather data to have "Temperature" as a column, so effectively a transposition of your current (pre-pivot) frame, which would result in much-simpler merging with your data. Regardless, though, what goes wrong with your merge attempt? It appears you are using dplyr, is there a reason you are not using one of the *_join functions? – r2evans 3 hours ago Add a comment | 0 Active Oldest Votes Know someone who can answer?
